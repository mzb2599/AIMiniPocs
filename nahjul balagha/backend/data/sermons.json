    "text": "In this sermon, he recalls the creation of the earth and sky \nand the birth of Adam:\n \nPraise is due to Allah Whose worth cannot be described by \nspeakers, whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose \nclaim (to obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so, \nwhom the height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate and the depths \nof understanding cannot reach; He, for whose description no limit has \nbeen laid down, no praise exists, no time is ordained and no duration is \nfixed. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed \nwinds through His Compassion and made firm the shaking earth with \nrocks.\n \n The foremost in religion is the acknowledgment of Him. The \nperfection of acknowledging Him is to testify Him. The perfection of \ntestifying Him is to believe in His Oneness. The perfection of believing \nin His Oneness is to regard Him Pure. The perfection of His purity is to \ndeny Him attributes because every attribute is a proof that it is different \nfrom that to which it is attributed and everything to which something is \nattributed is different from the attribute. Thus, whoever attaches \nattributes to Allah recognizes His like. Who recognizes His like regards \nHim as two. Who regards Him as two recognizes parts for Him, and who \nrecognizes parts for Him mistakes Him, and who mistakes Him points at \nHim, and who points at Him admits limitations for Him, and who admits \nlimitations for Him numbers Him. \n \n Whoever said in what is He, held that He is contained, and \nwhoever said on what is He held He is not on something else. He is a \nBeing but not through phenomenon of coming into being. He Exists but \nnot of non-Existence. He is with everything but not in physical nearness. \nHe is different from everything but not in physical separation. He acts \nbut without connotation of movements and instruments. He sees even \nwhen there is none to be looked at from among His creation. He is only \nOne, such that there is none with whom He may keep company or whom \nHe may miss in his absence. \nCreation of the Universe \n \nHe initiated creation and commenced it originally, without \nundergoing reflection, without making use of any experiment, without \ninnovating any movement and without experiencing any mental \naspiration. He allotted all things their times, put together their variations, \ngave them their properties and determined their features. He knew them \nbefore creating them, fully realizing their limits and confines and \nappreciated their propensities and intricacies. \n \n When the Almighty created the openings of the atmosphere, \nexpanse of firmament and strata of winds, He allowed water, whose \nwaves were stormy and whose surges leapt one over the other, to flow \nonto it. He loaded dashing winds and breaking typhoons, ordered them to \nshed it back (as rain), gave the wind control over the vigor of the rain and \nacquainted it with its limitations. The wind blew under it while water \nflowed furiously over it. \n \nThen, the Almighty created forth wind and made its movement \nsterile, perpetuated its status, intensified its motion and spread it far and \nwide. Then He ordered the wind to raise deep waters and to intensify the \nwaves of the oceans. So the wind churned the water like the churning of \ncurd and pushed it fiercely into the firmament, throwing its front status on \nthe rear while the stationary status flowed till its level was raised and the \nsurface was full of foam. Then Almighty raised the foam to the open wind \nand vast firmament and made therefrom the seven skies. He made the \nlower one as a stationary surge and the upper one as protective ceiling and \nhigh edifice without any pole to support it or nail to hold it together. Then \nHe decorated them with stars and the light of meteors and hung in it the \nshining sun and effulgent moon under the revolving sky, moving the \nceiling and rotating firmament. \nCreation of the Angels\n \nThen He created the openings between the high skies and filled \nthem with all classes of His angels. Some of them are in prostration and \ndo not rise. others are in kneeling positions and do not stand up Some of \nthem are in array and do not leave their status. others are extolling Allah \nand do not get tired. The sleep of the eye or the slip of wit or languor of \nthe body or effect of forgetfulness does not effect them. \nAmong them are those who work as trusted bearers of His \nmessage, those who serve, speaking tongues for His prophets and those \nwho carry His orders and injunctions. Among them are the protectors of \nHis creatures and guards of the doors of the gardens of Paradise. Among \nthem are those whose steps are fixed on earth but their necks protrude into \nthe skies. Their limbs are out on all sides, their shoulders are in accord \nwith the columns of the Divine Throne, their eyes are cast down before it, \nthey have spread their wings down under it and they have rendered \nbetween themselves and all else curtains of honor and screens of power. \nThey do not think of their Creator through image, do not impute created \nattributes to Him, do not confine Him within abodes and do not point at \nHim through illustrations. \nCreation of Adam (x)\n \nAllah collected clay from hard, soft, sweet and sour earth, which \nHe moistened with water till it became pure and kneaded it with moisture \ntill it became gluey. From it He carved an image with curves, joints, limbs \nand segments. He solidified it till it dried up for a fixed time and a known \nduration. Then He blew into it out of His Spirit whereupon it took the \npattern of a human being with a mind that governed him, intelligence \nwhich he made use of, limbs that served him, organs that changed his \nstatus, sagacity that differentiated between truth and untruth, tastes and \nsmells, colors and species. He was a mixture of clays of different colors, \ncohesive materials, divergent contradictories and differing properties like \nheat, cold, softness and hardness. \n \nThen Allah asked the angels to fulfil His promise with them and \nto accomplish the pledge of His injunction to them by acknowledging \nHim through prostration to Him and submission to His honored status. So \nAllah said: “Prostrate to Adam, so they prostrated except Iblis (Satan). \n(Holy Quran, 2: 34; 7: 11; 17: 61; 18: 50; 20: 116). Self-importance \nwithheld him and vice overcame him. So that he took pride in his own \ncreation with fire and treated the creation of clay contemptuously. So \nAllah allowed him time in order to let him fully deserve His wrath and to \ncomplete (man’s) test and to fulfil the promise (He had made to Satan). \nThus, He said: “Verily you have been allowed time till the known \nDay(Holy Quran, 15: 38, 38: 81). \n \nThereafter, Allah placed Adam (x) in a house where He made his \nlife and his stay safe and He cautioned him of Iblis and his enmity. Then \nhis enemy (Iblis) envied Adam’s abiding in Paradise and his contacts with \nthe virtuous. So he changed his conviction into wavering and \ndetermination into weakness. He thus converted his happiness into fear \nand his prestige into shame. Then Allah offered to Adam (x) the chance to \nrepent, taught him words of His Mercy, promised him return to His \nParadise and sent him down to the place of trial and procreation of \nProgeny. \nAllah Chooses His Prophets (x)\n \nFrom Adam’s progeny, Allah chose prophets and took their \npledge for His revelation and for carrying His message as their trust. \nThroughout the course of time many people perverted Allah’s trust with \nthem and ignored His status and took associates along with Him. Satan \nturned them away from knowing Allah and kept them aloof from His \nworship. Then Allah sent His Messengers and a series of His prophets \ntoward people to get them to fulfil the pledges of His creation, to recall \nHis bounties to them, to exhort them by preaching, to unveil before them \nthe hidden virtues of wisdom and to show them the signs of His \nOmnipotence. Of these signs He showed the sky which is raised over \nthem, the earth that is placed beneath them, a means of livelihood to \nsustain, death that makes them die, ailments that turn them old and \nincidents that successively betake them. \n \nAllah never allowed His creation to remain without a Prophet \n(h) deputed by Him, or a book sent down from Him or a binding \nargument or a standing plea. These Messengers were such that they did \nnot feel little because of smallness of their number or the largeness of the \nnumber of their falsifiers. Among them was either a predecessor who \nwould name the one to follow or the follower who had been introduced by \nthe predecessor. \nThe Prophethood of Muhammad (h)\n \nIn this way, ages passed by and times rolled on. Fathers passed \naway while sons took their places till Allah deputed Muhammad (h) as \nHis Prophet, in fulfillment of His promise and in completion of His \nProphethood. Muhammad’s pledge had been taken from the Prophet (h)\ns, his traits of character were well reputed and his birth was honorable. \nThe people of the earth at this time were divided in different parties, their \naims were separate and ways were diverse. They either loved Allah and \nHis creation or twisted His Names or turned to those other than Him. \nThrough Muhammad (h), Allah guided them out of wrong and with his \nefforts took them out of ignorance. \n \nThen Allah chose Muhammad (h) to meet Him, selected him for \nHis own nearness, regarded him too dignified to remain in this world and \ndecided to remove him from this place of trial. So He drew him towards \nHimself with honor. Allah may shower His blessing on him and his \nprogeny. \nThe Holy Quran and the Sunnah \n \nBut the Prophet (h) left among you the same that other prophets \nleft among their people, as Prophets do not leave their people \nintentionally (in the dark) without a clear path and a standing ensign. He \nleft the Book of your Creator clarifying its permission and prohibitions, \nits obligations and discretion, its repealing injunctions and the repealed \nones, its permissible matters and compulsory ones, its particulars and the \ngeneral ones, its lessons and illustrations, its long and the short ones, its \nclear and obscure ones, detailing its abbreviations and clarifying its \nobscurities.\n \nIn it there are some verses whose knowledge1 is obligatory and \nothers whose ignorance by the people is permissible. It also contains what \nappears to be obligatory according to the Book2 but its repeal is signified \nby the Prophet’s action (Sunnah) or that which appears compulsory \naccording to the Prophet’s action but the Book allows not following it. Or \nthere are those which are obligatory in a given time but not so after that \ntime. Its prohibitions also differ. Some are major ones for which there \nexists the threat of fire (Hell) and others are minor ones for which there \nare prospects of forgiveness. There are also those of which a small portion \nis also acceptable (to Allah) but they are capable of being expanded. \nIn this Same Sermon, He Spoke thus about the Hajj: \n \nAllah has made obligatory upon you the pilgrimage (hajj) to His \nsacred House which is the turning point for the people who go to it as \nbeasts or pigeons go towards spring water. Allah, the most Glorified One, \nmade it a sign of their supplication before His Greatness and their \nacknowledgment of His Dignity. He selected from among His creation \nthose, who on listening to His call, responded to it and testified to His \nword. They stood in the status of His Prophets and resembled His angels \nwho surround the Divine Throne securing all the benefits of performing \nHis worship and hastening towards His promised forgiveness. Allah, the \nmost Glorified One, made it (His sacred House) an emblem for Islam and \nan object of respect for those who turn to it. He made obligatory its \npilgrimage and laid down its claim for which He held you responsible to \ndischarge it. Thus, Allah, the most Glorified One, said: \n \n“Allah (purely) for Allah, is incumbent upon mankind, the \npilgrimage to the House, for those who can afford to journey thither. And \nwhoever denies, then verily Allah is Self-sufficiently independent of the \nWorlds” (Holy Quran, 3: 96). \n \nThe foremost in religion (din) is His knowledge. The literal \nmeaning of din is obedience and its popular sense is a code. whether the \nliteral sense is taken or the popular one, in either case, if the mind is \ndevoid of any conception of Divinity, there would be no question of \nobedience, nor of following any code because when there is no aim there \nis no point in advancing towards it. Where there is no object in view there \nis no sense in making efforts to achieve it. Nevertheless, when the nature \nand guiding faculty of man bring him in contact with a superior Authority \nand his taste for obedience and impulse of submission subjugates him \nbefore a Deity, he finds himself bound by certain limitations as against \nabject freedom of activity. These very limitations are din (religion) whose \npoint of commencement is knowledge of Allah and acknowledgment of \nHis Being. \n \nAfter pointing out the essentials of the Divine knowledge Amir, \nal-Mu’minin has described its important constituents and conditions. He \nholds those stages of such knowledge which people generally regard as \nthe point of highest approach to be insufficient. He says that its first stage \nis that with the natural sense of search for the unknown and the guidance \nof conscience or on hearing from the followers of religions an image of \nthe Unseen Being known as Allah is formed in the mind. This image, in \nfact, is the forerunner of the obligation to thinking and reflection and to \nseeking His knowledge. But those who love idleness, or are under \npressure of environment, do not undertake this search despite the creation \nof such an image and the image fails to get testified. In this case they \nremain deprived of the Divine knowledge. Since access to the stage of \ntestifying after the formation of image is by volition, they deserve to be \nquestioned about it. But one who is moved by the power of this image \ngoes further and considers thinking and reflection necessary. In this way \none reaches the next stage in the attainment of the Divine knowledge, \nnamely to search for the Creator through diversification of the creation \nand species of creatures. This is so because every picture is a solid and \ninflexible guide to the existence of its painter and every effect to the \naction of its cause. When he casts his glance around himself he does not \nfind a single thing which might have come into existence without the act \nof a maker so much so that he does not find the sign of a footstep without \na walker nor a construction without a builder. How can he comprehend \nthat this blue sky with the sun and the moon in its expanse and the earth \nwith the exuberance of its grass and flowers could have come into \nexistence without the action of a Creator? therefore, after observing all \nthat exists in the world and the regulated system of the entire creation no \none can help but conclude that there is a Creator for this world of \ndiversities because existence cannot come out of non-existence, nor can \nexistence sprout forth from nothingness. \n \nThe Holy Quran has pointed to this reasoning thus: “What?! \nabout Allah is there any doubt, the Originator of the heavens and the \nearth? (14: 10) \n \nBut this stage would also be insufficient if this testimony in favor \nof Allah is tarnished by belief in the divinity of some other deity. \n \nThe third stage is that His existence should be acknowledged \nalong with belief in Unity and Oneness. Without this the testimony to \nAllah’s existence cannot be complete because if more gods are believed \nin, He would not be One. Whereas it is necessary that He should be One. \nThe reason is that in case of more than one god the question would arise \nwhether one of them created all this creation or all of them together. If \none of them created it there should be some difference to distinguish him, \notherwise, he would be accorded preferential status without reason, which \nis unacceptable to the mind. If all have created it collectively then the \nstatus has only two forms; either he cannot perform his functions without \nthe assistance of others or he is above the need for their assistance. The \nfirst case means he is incapable and in need of others while the other case \nmeans that there are several regular performers of a single act and the \nfallacy of both has already been shown. If we assume that all the gods \nperformed the act of creation by dividing it among themselves, all the \ncreation would not bear the same relationship towards the creator. This is \nso because each creature will bear relationship only to its own creator \nwhereas every creature should have one and the same relationship to all \ncreators. This is so because all the creation should have one and the same \nrelationship to all the creators as all the created in their capacity to accept \neffect and all the creators in their capacity to produce effect should be \nsimilar. In short there is no way but to acknowledge Him as One because \nto believe in numerous creators allows no possibility of the existence of \nany other thing and destruction proves implicit for the earth, the sky and \neverything in creation. Allah, the most Glorified One, has expressed his \nargument in the following words: \n \nHad there been in the heavens and the earth [other]) gods except \nAllah, they both (the heavens and the earth would have been) in disorder. \n(Holy Quran, 21: 22). \n \nThe fourth stage is that Allah should be regarded free of all \ndefects and deficiencies, devoid of body, form, illustration, similarity, \nstatus of place or time, motion, stillness, incapability and ignorance. This \nis so because there can be no deficiency or defect in the perfect Being nor \ncan anyone be deemed like Him because all these attributes bring down a \nbeing from the high status of the Creator to the low status of the created. \nThat is why along with Unity, Allah has held purity from deficiency of \nequal importance. \n \nSay: He (Allah) is One (alone). Allah, the needless. He begets \nnot, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him. (Holy Quran, \n112: 1-4). \n \nVision perceives Him not and He perceives (all) vision; He is the \nSubtle, the All-aware. (Holy Quran, 6: 104). \n \nSo coin you not any similitudes to Allah; verily Allah knows \n(everything) and you know not. (Holy Quran, 16: 74). \n \nNothing whatsoever (is the re) like the like of Him, and He \n(alone) is the All-Hearing and the All-Seeing.(Holy Quran, 42: 11) \n \nThe fifth stage of completing His Knowledge is that attributes \nshould not be put on Him from outside lest there be duality in His \nOneness. Deviating from its proper connotation, Unity may fall into the \nlabyrinth of one-in-three and three-in-one because His Being is not a \ncombination of essence and form so that attributes may cling to Him like \nthe smell of the flowers or brightness in the stars. Rather, He is the \nfountainhead of all attributes and needs no medium for manifestation of \nHis perfect Attributes. If He is named Omniscient it is because the signs \nof his knowledge are manifest. If He is called Omnipotent it is because \nevery particle points to His Omnipotence and Activity. If the power to \nlisten or to see is attributed to him, it is because the cohesion of the entire \ncreation and its administration cannot be done without hearing or seeing. \nBut the existence of these attributes in Him cannot be held in the same \nway as in the creation. He should be capable to know only after He \nacquires knowledge or He should be powerful and strong only after \nenergy runs into His limbs because taking attributes as separate from His \nBeing would connote duality and where there is duality unity disappears. \nThat is how Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has rejected the idea of attributes \nbeing in addition to His Being, presented Unity in its true significance and \ndid not allow Unity to be tainted with stains of multiplicity. This does not \nmean that adjectives cannot at all be attributed to Him. This would be \ngiving support to those who are groping in the dark abyss of negativism, \nalthough every nook and corner in the entire Existence is brimming with \nHis attributes and every particle of creation stands witness that He has \nknowledge, He is powerful, He hears and He sees. He nurtures under His \ncare and allows growth under His mercy. The intention is that for Him, \nnothing can be suggested to serve as an adjunct to Him because His Self \nincludes attributes and His attributes connote His Self. Let us learn this \nvery theme in the words of Imam Abu `Abdillah Ja`far ibn Muhammad \nas-Sadiq (x) comparing it with the belief in Unity adopted by other \nreligions then appreciate who is the exponent of the true concept of Unity. \nThe Imam says the following: \n \nOur Lord, the Glorified One, the magnificent One, has knowledge \nof Himself even though there was nothing to know, sight of Himself even \nthough there is nothing to behold, hearing of Himself even though there is \nnothing to hear and Power of Himself even though there is nothing under \nHis Power. When He created the things and the object of knowledge came \ninto existence, His knowledge became related to the known, hearing \nrelated to the heard, sight related to the seen and Power related to its \nobject. (At-Tawhid by Shaikh as-Saduq, p.139). \nThis is the belief about which the Imams from among the \nProphet’s family are unanimous, but the majority group [of the Muslims, \ni.e. the Sunnis] has adopted a different course by creating the idea of \ndifferentiation between His Self and Attributes. Shahristani says the \nfollowing on, p. 42 of his book Kitab al-Milal wal-Nihal: “According to \nAbul-Hassan al-Ash`ari Allah knows through (the attribute of) \nknowledge, is Powerful through activity, speaks through speech, hears \nthrough hearing and sees through sight.” \n \nIf we regard attributes distinct from Self in this manner there \nwould be two alternatives; either the attributes must have existed in Him \nor they must have occurred later. In the first case we have to recognize as \nmany eternal objects as the attributes which all will share with Him in \nbeing eternal, but Allah is above that which people deem Him to have \nequals. In the second case, in addition to subjecting Him to the \nalternations, it would also mean that before the acquiring of the attributes \nHe was neither knowledgeable, nor powerful, nor hearer nor beholder, \nand this runs counter to the basic tenet of Islam. \n \nAllah has decreed trade lawful and has forbidden interest. (Holy \nQuran, 2: 275) \n \nAnd when you have finished the prayer remember Allah \nstanding and sitting and reacting and when you are secure (from danger) \nestablish prayer. (Holy Quran, 4: 103). \n \nO you men! Eat of what is in the earth lawful and good and \nfollow not the foot-steps of Satan; for verily he is an open enemy unto \nyou. (Holy Quran, 2: 168). \n \n(And) say: I am only a man like you, it is revealed unto me that \nyour god is but one Allah, therefore, whosoever desires to meet his \nMaster, let him do good deeds and associate not anyone in the worship of \nhis Master. (Holy Quran, 18: 110). \n \nWhat! enjoin you upon the people righteousness and you forget \nyour own selves? Yet you read the scripture? What?! Do you not \nunderstand?! (Holy Quran, 2: 44). \n \n2. About the Holy Quran, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) says that it \ncontains description of the permitted and forbidden acts such as Allah has \nallowed the sale and purchase but prohibited usury. \nIt clarifies obligatory and optional acts such as AWhen you have \nfinished the prayer, remember Allah rising, sitting or lying and when you \nfeel safe (from the enemy) then say the prayers (as usual) (4: 104). \n \nHere, prayer is obligatory while other forms of remembering \n(Allah) are optional. It has repealing and repealed verses such as about the \nperiod of seclusion after the husband’s death: four months and ten days, \nor the repealed one such as: till one year without going out. This shows \nthat this period of seclusion should be one year. In particular places it \npermits what is forbidden such as: “Whoever is compelled, without being \nwillfully wrongful or transgressing, commits no sins.” \n \nIt has positive injunctions such “One should not add anyone with \nAllah in worship. It has particular and general injunctions. Particular is \nthe one where the word shows generality but the sense is limited such as: \n“I have made you superior to other nations of the world, O Banu Isra’il.” \n \nHere, the meaning of “nations of the world” is confined to that \nparticular time, although the word is general in its literal meaning. The \ngeneral injunction is one which is extensive in meaning such as Allah has \nknowledge of everything. It has lessons and illustrations such as Allah \ncaught him in the punishment of this world and the next and there is a \nlesson in it. \n \nSo Allah seized him, with the chastisement in the hereafter and \nthe life before (it) (Holy Quran. 79: 25) \n \nVerily in this there is a lesson unto him who fears (Allah). (Holy \nQuran, 79: 26) \nA kind word and pardon is better than charity that is followed by injury \nand verily Allah is Self-sufficient, the Most forbearing. (Holy Quran, 2: \n263)\n \nAnd remember when We made a covenant with you and raised \nthe Tur (mountain) above you (saying): Hold you fast that which We \nhave bestowed upon you with the strength (of determination) and \nremember that which is the rein so that you may guard (yourself) against \nevil. (Holy Quran, 2: 63) \n \nSo we made it a lesson for (those of) their own times and for \nthose (of their posterity) who came after them and an exhortation unto \nthose who guard (themselves) against evil. (Holy Quran, 2: 66) \nHe it is Who fashions you in the wombs (of your mothers) as He \nlikes; There is no god but He, the All-mighty, the al-Wise. (Holy Quran, \n3: 5)\n \nObedience and a fair word; but when the affair is determined \nthen if they be true to Allah, it would certainly be better for them. (Holy \nQuran, 47: 21) \n \nO those who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women \nagainst their will, and do not straiten them in order that you may take a \npart of what you have given, unless they are guilty of manifest lewdness; \nbut deal kindly with them and if you hate them, it may be that you hate a \nthing while Allah has placed in it abundant good. (Holy Quran, 4: 19) \n \nSay (to the People of the Book):You dispute with us about Allah, \nwhile He is our Master and your Master, and for us are our deeds and for \nyou are yours; to Him (Alone) we are (exclusively) loyal? (Holy Quran, \n2: 139) \n \nThere is a lesson in it for whoever fears Allah, and illustrations \nsuch as “The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah \nis like a grain which grows seven ears each one of which bears hundred \ngrains.” It has unspecific and specific verses. Unspecific is one which has \nno limitation on specification such as “Recall when Moses told his people \nAllah commands you to sacrifice a cow.” \n \nSpecific is one where denotation is limited as Allah says that \nAthe cow should be such that it has neither been used for ploughing nor \nfor irrigation fields. There is clarity and obscurity in it. The clarity is that \nwhich has no intricacy such as “Verily Allah has sway over everything,” \nwhile the obscurity is whose meaning has complication such as “... the \nMerciful One (Allah) occupies the throne” the apparent meaning of which \ngives the impressions as if Allah is physically “sitting” on the Throne \nalthough the intention is to underscore His authority and control. In it \nthere are brief injunctions such as “Establish prayer” and those of deep \nmeanings such as the verses about which says the following: The meaning \nis not known except to Allah and to those immersed in knowledge. Then \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) deliberates on this theme in a different way, saying \nthat there are some things in it which are necessary to know, such as: “So \nbe informed that there is no god except Allah” and there are others which \nare not necessary to know such as Aleef, laam, meem, etc. It has also \ninjunctions which have been repealed by the Prophet’s actions such as \n“As for your women who commit adultery, get four male witnesses, and if \nfour witnesses do appear, shut such women in the house till death ends \ntheir life.” This punishment was current in early Islam but was later \nreplaced by stoning in the case of married women. In it, there are some \ninjunctions which repealed the Prophet’s actions such as “Turn your face \ntowards Masjid al-Haram by which the injunction for facing Bayt al-\nMaqdis (Jerusalem) was repealed. It also contains injunctions which are \nobligatory only at a particular time was repealed. It also contains \ninjunctions which are obligatory only at a particular time after which their \nobligation ends, such as “When the call for prayer is made on Friday, \nhasten towards remembrance of Allah.” It has also indicated grades of \nprohibitions as the division of sins into light and serious ones such as \n“Tell the believers to lower their gaze” and serious ones such as \n“Whoever kills a believer willfully, his penalty is to remain in Hell \nforever.” It also contains injunctions where a little performance is enough \nbut there is scope for further performance such as “Read the Holy Quran \nas much as you can.” \n \nVerily your Master, certainly is He the All-mighty, the All-\nmerciful. (Holy Quran, 26: 9) \n \nSay (O Our Prophet Muhammad [h]) to the believing men that \nthey should cast down their gaze and guard their private parts; that is \npurer for them; verily Allah is All-aware of whatever you do. (Holy \nQuran, 24: 30) \n \nNot equal are those of the believers who sit (holding back) to \nthose who are hurt and who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth \nand selves (lives). Allah has raised the strivers with their wealth and \nselves (lives) in rank above those sitting (holding back); to all (faithful) \nAllah has promised good: but those who strive He has distinguished \nabove those who sit (linger behind and not go out to fight for the faith) a \ngreat recompense. (Holy Quran, 4: 95) \n \nVerily, your Lord knows that you stand up (during the night for \nthe night prayers) two-thirds of the night and (sometimes) half of it and \n(sometimes) a third of it and(so does) a group of those with you, and \nAllah measures (well) the night and the day; He knows that you can \nnever take (correct) account of it, so He turns to you (mercifully); recite, \nthen, whatever is easy (in the prayers) to be read of the Holy Quran; He \nknows that there may be among you those who are sick and others \ntraveling in the earth seeking of the grace of Allah and others fighting in \nthe way of Allah, so recite as much as it can easily be done of it and \nestablish the (regular) prayers and pay the (prescribed) zakat and offer \nunto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good (deeds) you send forth \nbefore hand for yourselves, you will (surely) find it with Allah, that is the \nbest and the greatest recompense, and seek the forgiveness of Allah; \nVerily, Allah if Oft-forgiving, most Merciful. (Holy Quran, 73: 20)"

As a result the pillars of religion fell down, its traces \ncould not be discerned, its passages had been destroyed and its streets had \nfallen into decay. People obeyed Satan and tread his paths. They sought \n \n113This is a reference to the Preserved Tablet. \n \nI also testify that Muhammad (h) is the Prophet. Allah sent him \nwith the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written Book, effulgent\n light, sparkling gleam and decisive in junctions in order to dispel doubts,\npresent clear proofs, administer warning through signs and to warn of \npunishments. At that time people had fallen in vices whereby the \nrope of religion had been broken, the pillars of belief had been shaken,\nprinciples had been desecrated, system had become topsy turvy, \nopenings were narrow, passage was dark, guidance was unknown \nwater from his watering places. Through them Satan’s emblems flew and \nhis standard was raised in vices which trampled the people under their \nhoofs and treaded upon them with their feet. The vices stood on their toes \n(in full stature) and the people immersed in them were strayed, perplexed, \nignorant and seduced as though in a Good House114 with bad neighbors. \nInstead of sleep, they had wakefulness, and for antinomy, they had tears \nin the eyes. They were a land where the learned were in bridle (keeping \ntheir mouths shut) while the ignorant were honored. \n \nIn the same sermon, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) referred to Ahl al-\nBayt (x) (the Household of the Holy Prophet (h)) as follows:\n \nThey are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source \nof knowledge about Him, center of His wisdom, valleys for His books and \nmountains of His religion. With them, Allah straightened the bend of \nreligion’s back and removed the trembling of its limbs. \n \nIn the same sermon, he spoke about the hypocrites thus: \n \nThey sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested \ndestruction. Non in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the \nProgeny115\n \n114The “Good House” means Mecca, while the “bad neighbors” phrase \nrefers to unbelieving Quraishites. \n115About the Progeny of the Prophet (h), Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has said \nthat nobody in the world can be at par with them, nor can anyone be deemed their \nequal in sublimity because the world is over laden with their obligations and has \nbeen able to secure eternal blessings only through their guidance. They are the \ncorner stone and foundation of religion and the sustenance for its life and survival. \nThey are such strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the \nstormy flow of doubt and suspicion. They are such middle course among the paths \nof excess and backwardness that if some one goes far toward excess and \nexaggeration or falls behind then unless he comes back or steps forward to that \nmiddle course, he cannot be on the path of Islam. They possess all the \ncharacteristics which give the superiority in the right for vicegerency and \nleadership. Consequently, no one else in the umma enjoys the right of patronage \nand guardianship. That is why the Prophet (h) declared them his vicegerents and \nsuccessors. About will and succession the commentator ibn Abul-Hadid, the \nMu’tazilite scholar, writes that there can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) but succession cannot imply succession in status although the \nShi`ite sect has so interpreted it. It rather implies succession of learning. Now, if \naccording to him succession is taken to imply succession in learning even he does \nof the Prophet (h) (Ahl al-Bayt [x]). One who was under their obligation \ncannot be matched with them. They are the foundation of religion and the \npillar of belief. The forward runner has to turn back to them while the \nfollower has to overtake them. They possess the chief characteristics for \nvicegerency. In their favor exists the will and succession (of the Prophet \n(h)). This is the time when right has returned to its owner and diverted to \nits center of return."

    "text": "Known as the sermon as ash-Shaqshaqiyya 1\nBeware! By Allah, the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr) 2\ndressed himself with it (the caliphate) and he certainly knew that my \nstatus in relationship to it was the same as the status of the axis in \nrelationship to the hand-mill. The flood water flows down from me \nand the bird cannot fly up to me. I put a curtain against he caliphate \nand kept myself detached from it. \n \nThen I began to think whether I should assault or endure calmly \nthe blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the grown up are feeble and \n \nno seem to succeed in achieving his object because even by this interpretation the \nright of succeeding the Prophet (h) does not devolve on any other person. It is \nagreed upon that learning is the most essential requirement of khalifah (caliphate) \nbecause the most important of functions of the Prophet’s Caliph consist of \ndispensation of justice, solving problems of religious laws, clarifying intricacies \nand administration of religious penalties. If these functions are taken away from the \nProphet’s deputy, his status will come down to that of a worldly ruler. He cannot be \nregarded as the pivot of religious authority. Therefore, either we should keep \ngovernmental authority separate from Prophet’s vicegerency or accept the \nsuccessor of the Prophet’s knowledge to suit that status. \n \nThe interpretation of Ibn Abul-Hadid could be acceptable if Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) had uttered this sentence alone, but observing that it was uttered soon \nafter Ali’s (x) recognition as Caliph and just after it the sentence “Right has \nreturned to its owner” exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless. Rather, the \nProphet’s will cannot imply any other will except that for vicegerency and caliphate \nand succession would imply not succession in property nor in knowledge because \nthis was not an occasion to mention it here. But, it must mean the succession in the \nright leadership which stood proved as from Allah not only on the ground of \nkinship, but on the ground of qualities of perfection. \nthe young grow old and the true believer acts under strain till he meets \nAllah (on this death). I found that endurance thereon was wiser. So I \nadopted patience although there was pricking in the eye and suffocation \n(of mortification) in the throats. I watched the plundering of my \ninheritance till the first one went his way but handed over the Caliphate to \nibn al-Khattab after himself. \nThen he quoted a verse by al-A’sha and went on to say: \n \nMy days are now passed on the camel’s back (in difficulty) while \nthere were days (of ease) when I enjoyed the company of Ja bir’s brother \nHayyan.3\nIt is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from \nthe caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. No \ndoubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves. This one put \nthe caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and \nthe touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and also the excuses \ntherefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel. If \nhe pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let it loose he \nw9ould be thrown. Consequently, by Allah, people got involved in \nrecklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation. \n \nNevertheless, I remained patient despite a length of period and \nstiffness of trial, until when he went his way (of death) he put the matter \n(of Caliphate) in a group4 and regarded me to be one of them. But good \nHeavens! What had I to do with his “consultation”? Where was any doubt \nabout me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin \nto these ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high \nwhen they flew high. One of them turned against me because of his hatred \nand the other got inclined the other way due to his in-law relationship and \nthis thing and that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with \nheaving breasts between his dung and fodder. With him his children of \nthe grand-father (Umayyah) also stood up, swallowing up Allah’s wealth5\nlike a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his rope broke down, his \nactions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate. \n \nAt that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of \npeople rushing to me. It advanced toward me form every side like the \nmane of the hyena so much so that Hassan and Hussain were getting \ncrushed and both the ends of my shoulder garment were torn. They \ncollected around me like the herd of sheep and goats. When I took up the \nreins of government, one party broke away and another turned \ndisobedient while the rest began acting wrongfully as if they had not \nheard the word of Allah saying: \n \nThat abode in the hereafter, We assign if for those who intend not \nto exult themselves in the earth, nor (to make) mischief (the rein), and the \nend is (best) for the pious. (Holy Quran 28: 83) \n \nYes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world \nappeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them. \nBehold, by Him who split the grain (to grow) and created living beings, if \npeople had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the \nargument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to the \neffect that they should no acquiesce in the gluttony of the oppressor and \nthe hunger of the oppressed, I would have cast the rope of Caliphate on its \nown shoulders and would have given the lst one the same treatment as to \nthe first one. Then you would have seen that in my view this world of \nyours is not better than the sneezing of a goat. \n \nIt is said that when Amir al-Mu’minin (x) reached this point in \nhis sermon, a man from Iraq stood up and handed him something in \nwriting. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) began looking at it, whereupon Ibn Abbas \nsaid, “O Amir al-Mu’minin (x), I wish you resumed your sermon from \nwhere you broke it.” Thereupon, he replied, “O Ibn Abbas, it was like the \nfoam of a camel which gushed out but subsided.” Ibn Abbas said that he \nnever grieved over any utterance as he did over this one because Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) could not finish it as he wished to.\n \nAsh-Sharif ar-Radi says the following: The words in this sermon \nAlike the rider of a camel mean to convey that when a camel rider is stiff \nin drawing up the rein then in this scuffle the nostril gets bruised, but if he \nlets it loose in spite of the camel’s unruliness, it would thrown him \nsomewhere and would get out of control. Ash-shaqshaqah is used when \nthe rider holds up the rein and raises the camel’s head upwards. In the \nsame sense the word Ashanaqa an-naqah is use. Ibn as-Sikkit (the renown \nlinguist) has mentioned this in Islah al-Mantiq. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has \nsaid, “ashnaqa laha” instead of “aslasa laha” and harmony could be \nretained only by using both in the same form. Thus, Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) has used “ashanaq laha” as though in place of “in rafa’a laha ra saha”, \nthat is, “If he stops it by holding up the reins, etc.” \n1. This sermon is known as the sermon as ash-Shaqshaqiyya and \nis counted among the most famous sermons of Amir al-Mu’minin. It was \ndelivered at ar-Rahbah. Although some people have denied it to be Amir \nal-Mu’minin’s utterance and, by attributing it to Sayyid ar-Radi (or ash-\nSharif ar-Radi), have laid blame on the integrity of his acknowledge, yet \ntruth-loving scholars have denied its veracity. Nor can there be any \nground for this denial because Ali’s difference of view in the matter of \nCaliphate is not a secret matter, so that such hints should be regarded as \nsomething alien. And, the events which have been alluded to in this \nsermon are preserved in the annals of history which testify to them word \nby word and sentence by sentence. If the same events, which are related \nby history, are recounted by Amir al-Mu’minin (x), then what is the \nground for denying them? If the memory of discouraging circumstance \nfaced by him soon after the death of the Prophet (h) appeared \nunpalatable to him, it should not be surprising. No doubt, this sermon hits \nat the prestige of certain personalities and gives a set back to the faith and \nbelief in them, but this cannot be sustained by denying the sermon to be \nAmir al-Mu’minin’s utterance, unless the true events are analyzed and \ntruth unveiled. otherwise, just denying it to be Amir al-Mu’minin’s \nutterance because it contains disparagement of certain individuals carries \nno weight, when other historians have related similar criticism as well. \nThus (Abu Othman) Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz has recorded the following \nwords of a sermon of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) and thy are not less weighty \nthan the criticism in the Sermon of ash-Shaqshaqiyya. \n \nThose two passed away and the third one rose like the crow \nwhose courage is confined to the belly. It would have been better if both \nhis wings had been cut and his head severed. \n \n \nConsequently, the idea that it is the production of Sayyid ar-Radi \nis far from the truth and a result of partisanship and partiality. Or else if it \nis the result of some research, it should be bought out. otherwise, \nremaining in such wishful illusion does not alter the truth, nor can the \nforce of decisive arguments be curbed down by mere disagreement and \ndispleasure.\n \nNow, we set forth the testimony of those scholars and traditionists \nwho have clearly held it to be Amir al-Mu’minin’s production, so that its \nhistorical importance should become known. Among these scholars, some \nare those before Sayyid ar-Radi’s period, some are his contemporaries \nand some are those who came after him but they all related it through \ntheir own chain of authority. \n1) Ibn Abul-Hadid al-Mu’tazili writes that his master, Abul-\nKhayr Masaddiq ibn Shabib al-Sasiti (d. 605 A.H), states that he heard \nthis sermon from Shaikh Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn Amad al-\nBaghdadi (d. 567 A.H.), known as Ibn al-Khashshab and when he reached \nwhere Ibn Abbas expressed sorrow for this sermon having remained \nincomplete, Ibn al-Khashshab said to him that if he had heard the \nexpression of sorrow from ibn `Abbas, he would have certainly asked him \nif there had remained with his cousin any further unsatisfied desire \nbecause excepting the Prophet (h), he had already spared neither the \npredecessors nor followers and had uttered all that he wished to utter. \nTherefore, why should there by any sorrow that he could not say what he \nwished? Musaddiq says that ibn al-Khashshab was a man of folly heart \nand decent taste. I inquired form him whether he also regarded the sermon \nto be a fabrication when he replied, “By Allah, I believe it to be Amir al-\nMu’minin’s word as I believe you to Musaddiq ibn Shabib. I said that \nsome people regard it to be Sayyid ar-Radi’s production when he replied, \n“Who can ar-Radi have such guts or such style of writing. I have seen \nSayyid ar-Radi’s writings and know his style of composition. Nowhere \ndoes his writing match with this one and I have already seen it in books \nwritten two hundred years before the birth of Sayyid ar-Radi and I have \nseen it in familiar writings about which I know by which scholars or men \nof letters they were compiled. At that time not only ar-Radi, but even his \nfather Abu Ahmed an-Naqib had not been born. \n \n2) Thereafter ibn Abul-Hadid writes that he saw this sermon in \nthe compilations of his master abu-l-Qasim (Abdullah ibn Ahmed) al-\nBalkhi (d. 317 A.H). He was the Imam of the Mu’tazilites in the reign of \nal-Muqtadir-Billah while al-Muqtadir’s period was far earlier than the \nbirth of Sayyid ar-Radi. \n \n3) He further writes that he saw this sermon in Abu Ja`far \n(Muhammad ibn Abd ar-Rahman), Ibn Qibah’s book Al-Insaf. He was the \npupil of Abul-Qasim al-Balkhi and a theologian of the Imamiyya (Shi`ite) \nsect. See the Sharh of Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 1, pp. 205-206. \n \n4) Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (d. 679 A.H.) writes in his \ncommentary that he had seen one such copy of this sermon which bore \nthe writing of al-Muqtadir Billah’s minister Abul Hassan Ali ibn \nMuhammad ibn al-Furat (d. 312 A.H.). Sharh al-Balagha, Vol. 1l, pp. \n252-253 \n5) Al-Allama Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi has related the \nfollowing chain of authority about this sermon from Shaikh Qutbud-Din \nar-Rawandi’s compilation of Minhaj al-Bard’ah fi Sharh Nahjul-Balagha: \n \n6) In the context, Allama al-Majlisi has written that his sermon is \nalso co ntined in the compilations of Abu Ali (Muhammad ibn Abdul-\nWahhab) al-Juba’i (d. 303 A.H.) \n \n7) In connection with this very authenticity Allama al-Majlisi \nwrites the following:\n \nAl-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar ibn Ahmed al-Asad-Abadi (d. 415 A.H.) \nwho was a strict Mu’tazilite explains some expressions of this sermon in \nhis book Al-Mughni and tries to prove that it does not strike against any \npreceding caliph but does not deny it to be Amir al-Mu’minin’s \ncomposition. (ibid. p. 161) \n \n8) Abu Ja`far Muhammad ibn Ali, Ibn Babawayh (d. 381 A.H.) \nwrites the following:\n \nMuhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Ishaq at-Talaqani told us that Abdul-\nAziz ibn Yahya al-Jalludi (d. 332 A.H.) told him that Abu Abdillah \nAhmed ibn Ammar ibn Khalid told him that Yahya ibn Abdul-Hamid al-\nHimmani (d. 228 A.H) told him that Isa ibn Rashad related this sermon \nfrom Ali (x) ibn Hudhayfah and he from `Ikrimah and he from Ibn Abbas. \n(Ilal ash-Shara’i’, Vol. 1, pp. 122, p. 144: Ma’ani al-Akhbar, cha, p. 22, \npp. 360-361). \n \n9) then Ibn Babawayh records the following chain of authorities: \n \nMuhammad ibn Ali Majilawayh related this sermon to us and he \ntook it from his uncle Muhammad ibn Abul-Qasim and he form Ahmed \nibn Abu Abdillah (Muhammad ibn Khalid) al-Barqi and he from his \nfather and he from (Muhammad) ibn Abu Umayr and he from Aban ibn \nOthman and he from Aban ibn Taghlib and he from `Ikrimah and he from \nIbn Abbas. (AIlal al-Shara’i’, Vol. 1, cha, p. 122, p. 146; Ma’ani al-\nAkhbar, pp. 22, 361). \n \n10) Abu Ahmed al-Hassan ibn Abdillah ibnSa’id al-‘Askari (d; \n382 A.H.) who counts among great scholars of the Sunnis has written \ncommentary and explanation of this sermon that has been recorded by ibn \nBabawayh in AIlal ash-shara’i’ and Ma`aani al-Akhbar. \n11) As-Sayyid Ni’matullah al-Jaza’iri writes the following: \n \nThe author of Kitab al-Gharz, namely Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn \nMuhammad al-Thaqafi al-Kufi (d. 283 A.H.), has related this sermon \nthrough his own chain of authorities. The date of completion of writing \nthis book is Tuesday the 13th Shawwal 255 A.H. And in the same year, \nMurtada al-Musawi was born. He was older in age than his brother \nSayyid ar-Radi (Al-Anwar an-Nu’maniyya, p.37). \n \n12) Sayyid Radi ad-Din Abul-Qasim Ali ibn Musa, Ibn Tawus al-\nHussaini al-Hilli (d. 664 A.H.) has related this sermon from Kitab al-\nGharz with the following chain of authorities: \n \nThis sermon was related to us by Muhammad ibn Yusuf who \nrelated it from al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn `Abdul-Karim az-Za’far Sa’id and he \nform Muhammad ibn Zakariyyah al-Ghallabi and he from Ya’qub ibn \nJa`far ibn Sulayman and he from his father and he from his grandfather \nand he from ibn `Abbas. (Translation of Al-Tara’if, p. 202) \n \n13) Shaikh al-Ta’ifa, Muhammad ibn al-Hassan at-Tusi (d. 460 \nA.H.) writes the following: \n \n(Abul-Fath Hilal ibn Muhammad ibn Ja`far) al-Haffar related this \nsermon to us. He related it from Abul-Qasim (Isma’il ibn Ali ibn Ali \n(Du’bul and he from his father and he from his brother Du’bul (ibn Ali al-\nKhuza’i) and he from Muhammad ibn Salamah al-Shami and he from \nZurarh ibn A’yan and he from Abu Ja`far Muhammad ibn Ali (Shaikh al-\nSaduq) and he from Ibn Abbas (Al-Amli, p. 237). \n \n14) Shaikh al-Mufid (Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn an-\nNu’man, (d. 413 A.H.) who was the teacher of Sayyid ar-Radi writes \nabout he chain of authorities of this sermon; \n \nA number of narrators of traditions have related this sermon form \nibn Abbas through numerous chains (Al-Irshad, p. 135). \n \n15) Alam al-Huda (flag-posts of guidance) Sayyid al-Murtada, \nwho was the elder brother of Sayyid ar-Radi, has recorded it on pp. 203-\n204 of his book Al-Shafi. \n \n16) Abu Mansur at-Tibrisi writes the following: \nA number of relaters have given an account of this sermon from \nIbn Abbas through various chains. Ibn Abbas said that he was in the \naudience of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) at ar-Rahba (a place in Kufa which \nremains bearing this name) when conversation turned to caliphate and \nthose who had preceded him as Caliphs when Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nberated a sign and delivered this sermon.116\n \n17) Abul-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Abdillah and Sibt ibn al-Jawzi al-\nHanafi (d. 654 A.H.) write the following:\n \nOur Shaikh Abul Qasim an-Nafis al-Anbari related this sermon to \nus through his chain of authorities that ends with ibn Abbas, who said that \nafter allegiance had been paid to Amir al-Mu’minin (x) as caliph, he was \nsitting on the pulpit when a man from the audience inquired why he had \nremained quiet still then, whereupon Amir al-Mu’minin (x) delivered this \nsermon ex-tempore. (Tadhkirat Khawass al-Umma, p. 73) \n \n18) Judge Ahmed ibn Muhammad, ash-Shihab al-Khafaji (d. \n1069 A.H.) writes the following with regard to its authenticity: \n \nIt is stated in the utterances of Amir al-Mu’minin Ali (x) that AIt \nis strange during his lifetime he (Abu Bakr) wanted to give up the \nCaliphate, but he strengthened its foundation fo the other one after his \ndeath.) (Sharh Durrat al-Ghawwas, p. 17)\n \n19) Shaikh Ala ad-Dawla as-Simnani writes the following: “The \nCommander of the Faithful and the master of people of knowledge Ali (x)\nhas stated in one of his brilliant sermons: ‘This is the Shaqshaqah that \nburst forth’ as we read in Al-Urway li ahl al-khalwa wal-jalwa, p. 3, a \nmanuscript at the Nasiriyya Library, Lucknow, India.” \n \n20) Abul-Fadl Ahmed ibn Muhammad al-Maydani (d. 518 A.H.) \nhas written in connection with the word Shaqshaqa: \n \nOne sermon of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) Ali is known as Khutbat \nash-Shaqshaqiyya (sermon of the camel’s foam) (Majma’ al-Amthal, Vol. \n1, p 369). \n \n116al-Tibrisi, Al-Ihtijaj, p. 101. \n21) In fifteen places in Al-Nihaya, while explaining the words of \nthis sermon, Abus-Sa’ada, namely Mubarak ibn Muahmmed ibn al-Athir \nal-Jazri (d. 606 A.H) has acknowledged it to be Amir al-Mu’minin’s \nutterance.\n \n22) Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Patni, while explaining the same \nwords in Majma’ Bihar al-Anwar, testifies that this sermon belongs to \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x), saying, “Ali (x) says so. \n \n23) Abul-Fadl ibn Manzur (d. 711 A.H.) has acknowledged it as \nAmir al-Mu’minin’s utterance in his lexicon titled Lisan al-`Arab, Vol. \n12, p. 54 by saying, “In the sayings of Ali in his sermon AIt is the camel’s \nfoam that burst forth then subsided. \n \n24) Mujaddid al-Din, namely al-Firuz Aabadi (d. 816/817) A.H.) \nhas recorded under the words Shaqshaqa in his lexicon (Al-Qamus, Vol. \n3, p. 251) \n \nThe Shaqshaqiyya sermon is by Ali (x); it is named so because \nwhen Ibn Abbas asked him to resume it where he had left it, he said, \n“OIbn Abbas! It was the foam of a camel that burst forth then subsided. \n \n25) the compiler of Muntaha al-Adab writes the following: \n \nThe Shaqshaqiyya of Ali is attributed to Ali (Allah may honor his \nface).\n \n26) Shaikh Muhammad `Abdoh, themufti of Egypt, recognizing it \nas Amir al-Mu’minin’s utterance, has written its explanations. \n \n27) Muhammad Muhyi’d-Din `Abdul-Hamid, professor of Arabic \nat Al-Azhar University, has written annotations on Nahjul-Balagha, \nadding a Foreword in the beginning wherein he recognizes all such \nsermons which contain disparaging remarks to be the utterances of Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x).\n \n In the face of these evidences and undeniable proofs is there any \nscope to hold that it is not Amir-al-Mu’minin’s production and that \nSayyid ar-Radi prepared it himself? \n \n28) Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has referred to Abu Bakr’s accession \nto the caliphate metaphorically as having dressed himself with it. This \nwas a common metaphor. Thus, when Othman was called to give up the \nCaliphate, he replied, “I shall not put off this shirt which Allah has put on \nme. No doubt Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has not attributed this dressing of \nCaliphate to Allah, but to Abu Bakr himself with the Caliphate. He knew \nthat this outfit had been stitched for this own body and his status with \nrelationship to the Caliphate was that of the axis in the hand-mill which \ncannot retain its central status without it nor be of any use. Similarly, he \nheld “I was the central pivot of the Caliphate, were I not the re, its entire \nsystem would have gone astray from the pivot. It was I who acted as a \nguard for its organization and order and guided it through all difficulties. \nCurrents of learning flowed form my bosom and watered it on all sides. \nMy status was high beyond imagination but lust of world seekers for \ngovernance became a tumbling stone for me and I had to confine myself \nto seclusion. Blinding darkness prevailed all around and there was intense \ngloom everywhere. The young grew old and the old departed for the \ngraves but this patience-breaking period would not end. I kept watching \nwith my eyes the plundering of my own inheritance and saw the passing \nof Caliphate from one hand to the other but remained patient as I could \nnot stop their high-handedness for lack of means.” \n \nNeed for the Prophet’s Caliph and the Method of his \nAppointment \n \nAfter the Prophet (h) of Islam the presence of such a personality \nwas inevitable who could stop the community form disintegration and \nguard the religious law against change, alteration and interference by \nthose who wanted to twist it to suit their own desires. If this very need is \ndenied then there is no sense in attaching so much importance to the \nsuccession of the Prophet (h) that the assemblage in saqifa of Banu\nSa`idah should have been considered more important than the burial of \nthe Prophet (h). If the need is recognized, the question is whether or not \nthe Prophet (h), too, realized it. If it is held he could not attend to it and \nappreciate its need or absence of need it would be the biggest proof for \nregarding the Prophet’s mind to be blank for thinking of means to stop the \nevils of innovations and apostasy in spite of having given warning about \nthem. If it is said that he did realize it but had to leave it unresolved on \naccount of some advantage, then instead of keeping it hidden, the \nadvantage should be clearly indicated; otherwise, silence without purpose \nwould constitute delinquency in the discharge of the obligations of \nProphethood. If there was some impediment, it should be disclosed; \notherwise, we should agree that just as the Prophet (h) did not leave any \nitem of religion incomplete, he did not leave this matter either and did \npropose such a course of action for it, that if it was acted upon religion \nwould have remained safe against the interference of others. \n \n The question now is that was that course of action. If it is taken \nto be the consensus of opinion of the community, then it cannot truly take \nplace as in such consensus acquiescence of every individual is necessary; \nbut taking into account the difference in human temperaments, it seems \nimpossible that they would agree on any single point. Nor is there any \nexample where on such matters there has been no single voice of dissent. \nHow then can such a fundamental need be made dependent on the \noccurrence of such an impossible even B need on which converges the \nfuture of Islam and the good of the Muslims. Therefore, the mind is not \nprepared to accept this criterion. Nor is tradition in harmony with it, as \njudge Adud ad-Din al-`Iji has written in Sharh al-Mawaqif: “You should \nknow that Caliphate cannot depend upon unanimity of election because \nno logical or traditional argument can be advanced for it. \n \n In fact, when the advocates of unanimous election found that \nunanimity of all votes is difficult they adopted the agreement of the \nmajority as a substitute for unanimity, ignoring the difference of the \nminority. Also, in such a case, it often happens that the force of fair and \nfoul would correct and incorrect ways turns the flow of the majority \nopinion in the direction where there is neither individual distinction nor \npersonal merit as a result of which competent persons remain hidden \nwhile incompetent individuals stand forwards. When capabilities remain \nso cubed and personal ends stand in the way as hurdles, how can there be \nexpectation for the election of the correct person. Even if it is assumed \nthat all voters have independent, unbiased views, that no one has his own \nobjective and that none has any other consideration, it is not necessary \nthat every verdict of the majority should be correct and that it cannot go \nastray. Experience shows that after experiment, the majority has held its \nown verdict to be wrong. If every verdict of the majority is correct then its \nfirst verdict should be wrong because the verdict, which holds it wrong, is \nalso that of the majority. In this circumstance, if the election of the Caliph \ngoes wrong, who would be responsible for the mistake and who should \nface the blame for the ruination of the Islamic polity. Similarly on whom \nwould be the liability for the bloodshed and slaughter following the \nturmoil and activity of the elections? When it has been seen that even \nthose who sat in the audience of the Holy Prophet (h) could not be free \nof mutual quarrel and strife, how can other avoid it? \n If, with a view to avoid mischief, it is left to the people of \nauthority to choose anyone they like, then here too, the same friction and \nconflict would prevail because here again, convergence of human \ntemperaments on one point is not necessary nor can they be assumed to \nrise above personal ends. In fact, here the chances of conflict and collision \ncould be stronger because if not all, at least most of them would \nthemselves, be candidates for that status and would not spare any effort to \ndefeat their opponent, creating impediments I his way as best as possible. \nIts inevitable consequence would be mutual struggle and mischief-\nmongering. Thus, it would not be possible to ward off the mischief for \nwhich this device was adopted and instead of finding a proper individual, \nthe community would just become an instrument for the achievement of \npersonal benefits of the others. Again, what would be the criterion for \nthese people in authority? The same as has usually been, namely whoever \ncollects a few supporters and is able to create commotion in any meeting \nby use of forceful words would count among the people of authority. Or \nwould capabilities also be judged? If the mode of judging the capabilities \nis again this very common vote, then the same complications and conflicts \nwould arise here too, to avoid in which this way was adopted. If there is \nsome other standard, then instead of judging the capabilities of the voter \nby it, why not judge the person who is considered suitable for the status in \nview. Furthermore, how many persons in authority would be enough to \ngive a verdict? Apparently a verdict once accepted would be precedent for \ngood and the number that would give this verdict would become the \ncriterion for the future. Judge Adud ad-Din al-`Iji writes the following: \n“Rather, the nomination of one or two individuals by the people in \nauthority is enough because we know that the companions who were strict \nin religion deemed it enough as the nomination of Abu Bakr by Umar and \nof Othman by Abd ar-Rahman as we read on p. 351 of Sharh al-Mawaqif. \n \n This is the account of the unanimous election in the Hall of Banu \nSa`idah and the activity of the consultative assembly; that is, one man’s \naction has been given the name of unanimous election and individual’s \ndeed given the name of consultative assembly. Abu Bakr had well \nunderstood this reality that election means the vote of the person or two \nonly which is to be attributed to common simple people. That is why he \nignored the requirements of unanimous election, majority vote or method \nof choosing through electoral assembly and appointed `Umar by \nnomination. Aisha also considered that leaving the question of caliphate \nto the vote of a few particular individuals means inviting mischief and \ntrouble. She sent a word to `Umar on his death saying: \nDo not leave the Islamic community without a chief. Nominate a \nCaliph for it and leave it not without an authority as; otherwise, I \napprehend mischief and trouble. \n \nWhen the election by those in authority proved futile is was given \nup and only “might is right” became the criteria, namely whoever subdues \nothers and binds them under his sway and control is accepted as the \nCaliph of the Prophet (h) and his true successor. These are those self-\nadopted principles in the face of which all the Prophet’s saying uttered in \nthe “Feast of the relatives,” on the night of hijra, at the battle Tabuk, on \nthe occasion of conveying the Quranic chapter Bara’a (Tawba, Ch. 9) and \nat Ghadir (the swamp of) Khumm. The strange thing is that when each of \nthe first three caliphates is based on one individual’s choice, how can this \nvery right to choose be denied to the Prophet (h) himself, particularly \nwhen this was the only way to end all the dissensions, namely that the \nProphet (h) should have himself settled it and saved the community from \nfuture disturbances and spared it from leaving this decision I the hands of \npeople who were themselves involved in personal aims and objects. This \nis the correct procedure which stands to reason and which also has the \nsupport of the Prophet’s definite sayings. \n \nHayyan ibn as-Samin al-Hanafi of Yamama was the chief of the \ntribe Banu Hanifah and the commander of the fortress and the army. Jabir \nis the name of his younger brother while al-Asha whose real name was \nMaymun ibn Qays ibn Jandal enjoyed the status of being his bosom friend \nand led a decent, happy life through his bounty. In this verse, he has \ncompared his current life with the previous one that is the days when he \nroamed about in search of livelihood and those when he led a happy life \nin Hayyan’s company. Generally, Amir al-Mu’minin’s quoting of this \nverse has been taken to compare this troubled period with the peaceful \ndays passed under the care and protection of the Prophet (h) when he \nwas free from all sorts of troubles and enjoyed mental peace. But taking \ninto account he occasion for making this comparison and the subject \nmatter of the verse, it would not be far-fetched if it is taken to indicate the \ndifference between the unimportant status of those in power during the \nProphet’s life time and the authority and power enjoyed by them after \nhim. That is, at one time in the days of the Prophet (h) no heed was paid \nto them because of Ali’s personality but now the time had so changed that \nthe same people were masters of the affairs of the Muslim world. \n \nWhen Umar was wounded by Abu Lulu’ah and he saw that it was \ndifficult for him to survive because of the deep wound, he formed a \nconsultative committee and nominated Ali (x) ibn Abu Talib, `Othman \nibn Affan, Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf, az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Sa`d ibn \nAbu Waqqas and Talhah ibn Ubaydillah. Then, he bound them that after \nthree days of his death, they should select one of themselves as the Caliph \nwhile for those three days Suhayb should act as Caliph. On receipt of \nthese instructions, some members of the committee requested him to \nindicate what ideas he had about each of them to enable them to proceed \nfurther in their light. Umar, therefore, disclosed his own view about each \nindividual. He said that Sa`d is harsh-tempered and hot-headed; `Abd ar-\nRahman was Pharaoh of the community; as-Zubayr was, if pleased, a true \nbeliever, but if displeased, an un-believer; Talhah was the embodiment of \npride and haughtiness and if he was made caliph, he would put the ring of \nthe caliphate on his wife’s finger while Othman did not see beyond his \nkinsmen. As regarding Ali (x), he is enamored of the Caliphate although I \nknow that he alone can run it on the right lines. Nevertheless, despite this \nadmission, he thought it necessary to constitute the consultative \ncommittee and in selecting its members and laying down the working \nprocedure, he made sure that the Caliphate would take the direction in \nwhich he wished to turn it. Thus, a man of ordinary prudence can draw \nthe conclusion that all the factors for `Othman’s success were present the \nrein. If we look at its members, we see that one of the them, namely Abd \nar-Rahman ibn Awf is the husband of Othman’s sister, next Sa`d ibn Abu \nWaqqas besides bearing malice towards Ali (x) is a relative and kinsman \nof Abd ar-Rahman. Neither of them can be taken to go against `Utham. \nThe third, Talhah ibn `Ubaydullah about who Professor Muhammad Abdo \nwrites in this annotation on Nahjul-Balagha: \nTalhah was inclined towards Othman and the reason for it was \nno less than that he was against Ali because he himself was an At-\nTaymi’ and Abu Bakr’s accession to the caliphate had created bad blood \nbetween Banu Taym and Banu Hashim. \nAs regarding az-Zubayr, even if he had voted for Ali what could \nhis single vote achieve. According to al-Tabari’s statement, Talhah was \nnot present in Medina at that time, but his absence did not stand in the \nway of `Othman’s success. Rather, even if he were present, was reached \nat themeeting (of the Committee) and he was taken to be Ali’s supporter, \nstill there could be no doubt in Othman’s success because Omer’s \nsagacious mind had set the working procedure that: \nIf two agree about one and the other two about another then \nAbdullah bin Umar should act as the arbitrator. The group whom he \norders should choose the Caliph from among themselves. If they do not \naccept Abdullah ibn `Omer’s verdict, support should be given to the \ngroup which includes Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf, but if the others do not \nagree they should be beheaded for opposing this verdict.117\n \nHere, the disagreement with the verdict of Abdullah ibn Umar has \nno meaning since he was directed to support the group which included \nAbd ar-Rahman ibn Awf. He had ordered his son Abdullah and Suhayb \nthat:\n \nIf the people differ, you should side with themajority, but if three \nof them are on one side and the other three on the other, you should side \nwith the group including Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf as we see in al-Tabari, \nVol. 1, pp. 2725, 2789; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, pp. 51, 67. \n \nIn this instruction, the agreement with themajority also means \nsupport of Abd ar-Rahman because themajority could not be on any other \nside since fifty blood-thirsty swords had been put on the heads of the \nopposition group with orders to fall on their heads on Abd ar-Rahman’s \nbehest. Amir al-Mu’minin’s eye had foreseen it at that very moment that \nthe caliphate was going to Othman as appears from his following words \nwhich he spoke to Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib: “The Caliphate has been \nturned away from us.” Al-Abbas asked how he could know it. He replied, \n“`Othman has also been coupled with me and it has been laid down that \nthe majority should be supported; but if two agree on one and two on the \nother, then support should be given to the group which includes `Abd ar-\nRahman ibn Awf.” Now Sa`d will support his cousin Abd ar-Rahman \nwho is of course, the husband of Othman’s sister according to the same \nreference cited above. \n \nHowever, after Omer’s death, this meeting took place in the room \nof Aisha and on its door stood Abu Talhah al-Ansari with fifty men \nhaving drawn swords in their hands. Talhad started the proceedings and \ninviting all others to be witness said hat he gave his right of vote to \nOthman. This touched az-Zubayr’s sense of honor as his mother, Safiyya \ndaughter of Abdul-Muttalib, was the sister of the Prophet’s father. So, he \ngave his right of vote to Ali. Thereafter, Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas made his \nright of vote to Abd ar-Rahman. This left three members of the \nconsultative committee out of whom Abd ar-Rahman said that he was \nwilling to give up his own right of vote if Ali (x) and Othman gave him \n \n117al-Tabari, Vol. 1 pp. 2779-80; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, p. 67. \nthe right to choose one of them or one of these two should acquire this \nright by withdrawing. This was a trap in which Ali had been entangled \nfrom all sides, namely that either he should abandon his own right or else \nallow Abd ar-Rahman to do as he wished. The first case was not possible \nfor him; that is, to give up his own right and elect Othman or Abd ar-\nRahman. So, he clung to his right, while Abd ar-Rahman, separating \nhimself from it, assumed this power and said to Amir al-Mu’minin (x), AI \npay you allegiance on your following the Book of Allah, the Sunnah \n(teachings) of the Prophet (h) and the conduct of the two Shaikhs (Abu \nBakr and Umar). Ali (x) replied, “Rather on following the book of Allah, \nthe Sunnah of the Prophet (h) and my own findings. When Abd ar-\nRahman got the same reply even after repeating the question thrice, he \nturned to Othman saying, “Do you accept these conditions?” `Othman had \nno reason to refuse and so he agreed to the conditions and allegiance was \npaid to him. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) saw his rights being trampled, \nhe said: “This is not the first day when you behaved against us. I have \nonly to keep good patience. Allah is the Helper against whatever you say. \nBy Allah, you have not made Othman caliph but in hope that he would \ngive back the caliphate to you.” \n \n After recording the events of the shura (consultative committee), \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written that when allegiance had been paid to \nOthman, Ali (x) addressed Othman and Abd ar-Rahman saying, “May \nAllah sow the seed of dissension among you, and so it happened that each \nturned a bitter enemy of the other and Abd ar-Rahman did not ever after \nspeak to Othman till death. Even on his deathbed, he turned his face on \nhim. \n \nOn seeing these events, the question arises whether shura \n(consultative committee) means confining the matter to six persons, \nthereafter to three and finally to one only. Also, whether the condition of \nfollowing the conduct of the two Shaikhs [Abu Bakr and Umar] for \ncaliphate was put by Umar or it was just a hurdle put by Abd ar-Rahman \nbetween Ali (x) and the caliphate, although the first caliph did not put \nforth this condition at the time of nominating the second caliph, namely \nthat he should follow the former’s footsteps. What then, was the occasion \nfor this condition here? \n \nHowever, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) had agreed to participate in it in \norder to avoid mischief and to put an end to arguing so that others should \nbe silenced and should not be able to claim that they would have voted in \nhis favor and that he, himself, evaded the consultative committee and did \nnot give them an opportunity of selecting him. \n \nAbout the reign of the third caliph [Othman ibn Affan], Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) says that soon on Othman’s coming to power Banu \nUmayyah got ground and began plundering the bayt al-mal ) (public fund) \nand just as cattle on seeing green grass after a drought trampled it away, \nthey recklessly feel upon Allah’s money and devoured it. At last, this self-\nindulgence and nepotism brought him to the stage when people besieged \nhis house, put him to the sword and made him vomit all that he had \nswallowed.\n \nThe mis-administration that took place in this period was such \nthat no Muslim can remain unmoved to see that companions of high status \nwere lying without anyone to care for them, they were stricken with \npoverty and surrounded by bankruptcy while control over bayt al-mal \n(public fund) was that of Banu Umayyah, government positions were \noccupied by their young and inexperienced persons, special Muslim \nproperties were owned by them, meadows provided grazing but to their \ncattle, houses were built but by them and orchards were but for them. If \nany compassionate person spoke about these excesses, his ribs were \nbroken and if someone agitated this capitalism, he was expelled from the \ncity. The uses to which zakat (poor-rate) and charities which were meant \nfor the poor and the wretched and the public fund which was the common \nproperty of the Muslims were put may be observed from the following \nfew illustrations:\n \n1) Al-Hakam ibn Abul-As who had been exiled form Medina by \nthe Prophet (h), was allowed back in the city, not only against the \nProphet’s Sunnah (teachings) but also against the conduct of the first two \nCaliphs. He was paid three hundred thousand dirhams form the public \nfund. (Ansab al-Ashraf, Vol. 5, pp. 27, 28, 125) \n \n2) Al-Walid ibn Uqbah, who has been naed hypocrite in the Holy \nQuran, was piad one hundred thousand Dirhams from the Muslims’ \npublic fund (Al-Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 3, p. 94). \n \n3) The caliph married his own daughter, Umm Aban, to Marwan \nibn al-Hakam and paid him one hundred thousand dirhams for the public \nfund (Sharh of Iban Abul-Hadid, Vol. 1, pp. 198-199). \n \n4) He married his daughter Aisha to Harith ibn al-Hakam and \ngranted him one hundred thousand dirhams for the public fund (Ibid.). \n5) Abdullah ibn Khalid was paid four hundred dirhams as we read \non p. 84 of Al-Ma’arif of Ibn Qutaybah. \n \n6) He allowed the khums (one-fifth religious tax) from Africa \n(amounting) to five hundred thousand dnars to Marwan ibn al-Hakam, \naccording to the same reference. \n \n7) Fadak, which was withheld from the angelic daughter of the \nProphet (h) on the ground of being general charity, was given as a royal \nfavor to Marwan ibn al-Hakam. See the same reference cited above. \n \n8) Mahzur, a place in the commercial area of Medina which had \nbeen declared, “public trust by the Prophet (h), was gifted to Harith ibn \nal-Hakam, according to the same reference. \n \n9) In the meadows around Medina, no camel except those of \nBanu Umayyah were allowed to graze, as we read in the Sharh of Ibn \nAbul-Hadid, Vol. 1, p. 199. \n \n10) After his Othman’s death, one hundred and fifty thousand \ndinars (gold coins) and one million Dirhams (silver coins) were found in \nhis house. There was no limit to tax-free lands and the total value of the \nland estate he owned in Wadi al-Qura and Hunain was one hundred \nthousand dinars. There were countless camels and horses. according to \nMuruj al-Dhahab, Vol. 1, p.435. \n \n11) the Caliph’s relatives ruled all the principal cities. Thus, at \nKufa, al-Walid ibn `Uqbah was the governor, but when in the state of \nintoxication of wine, he led the morning prayer in four instead of two \nrak’ah. People were agitated and demanded his removal, but the Caliph \nput in his place a hypocrite like Sa’id ibn al-As. In Egypt, `Abdullah ibn \nSa`d ibn Abu Sarh, in Syria Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan and in Basra, \nAbdullah ibn Amir were the governors appointed by him (ibid)."

He \nwas coming back when on his way he got the news of this tragedy. At once, he \ninquired who had become the leader the chief. He was told that people had paid \nallegiance to Abu Bakr. On hearing this, the acknowledged mischief-monger of \nArabia went into deep thought and eventually went to Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib \nwith a proposal. He said to him, “Look! These people have by contrivance handed \nover the Caliphate to the Taym and deprived Banu Hashim of it for good. And, \nafter himself, this man will place over our heads a haughty man from Banu Adiy. \nLet us go to Ali bin Abu Talib (x) and ask him to get out of his house and take arms \nto secure his right.” So, taking Abbas with him, he went to Ali (x) and said: “Give \nme your hand. I pledge allegiance to you, and if anyone rises in opposition, I will \nfill the streets of Medina with men of cavalry and infantry.” This was the most \ndelicate moment for Amir al-Mu’minin (x). He regarded himself as the true master \nand successor of the Prophet (h), while a man with the backing of a tribe such as \nthat of Abu Sufyan was ready to support him. Just a signal was enough to ignite the \nflames of war. But Amir al-Mu’minin’s foresight and right judgment saved the \nMuslims from civil war as his piercing eyes perceived that this man wanted to start \na civil war by rousing the passions of tribal partisanship and distinction of birth so \nthat Islam would be struck with a convulsion that would shake it to its roots. Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x), therefore, rejected his counsel and admonished him several and \nspoke forth the words, whereby he had stopped people form mischief-mongering \nand undue conceit. He declared his stand to be, for him, there were only two \ncoursesCeither take up arms or sit quietly at home. If he rose for war, there were no \nsupporters so that he could suppress the rising insurgence. The only course left was \nto quietly wait for the opportunity until circumstances were favorable. \nx) as the Caliph \nperson who swallows it. One who plucks fruits before ripening is like one \nwho cultivated in another’s field. \n \nIf I speak out they would call me greedy towards power, but if I \nkeep quiet they would say I was afraid of death. It is a pity that after all \nthe ups and downs (I have been through). By Allah, the son of Abu \nTalib120 is more familiar with death than an infant with the breast of its \nmother. I have hidden knowledge; if I disclose it you will start trembling \nlike ropes in deep wells. \n \nAmir al-Mu’minin’s calm at this stage was indicative of his high \npolicy and far-sightedness because if in those circumstances Medina had \nbecome the center of war, its fire would have engulfed the whole of \nArabia in its flames. The discord and scuffle that had already begun \namong the Muhajirun and the ansar would have increased to maximum, \nthe wire-pulling of the hypocrites would have had full play and Islam’s \nship would have been caught in such a whirlpool that its balancing would \nhave been difficult. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) suffered trouble and \ntribulations, but did not raise his hands. History is witness that during his \nlife at Mecca, the Prophet (h) suffered all sorts of troubles but he was not \nprepared to clash or struggle by abandoning patience and endurance \nbecause he realized that if war took place at that stage the way for Islam’s \ngrowth and fruition would be closed. Of course, when he had collected \nsupporters and helpers enough to suppress the flood of unbelief and curb \n \n120About the death, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) says that it is so dear to him that \neven an infant does not so love to leap towards the source of its nourishment while \nin its mother’s lap. An infant’s attachment with the breast of its mother is under the \neffect of a natural impulse, but the dictates of natural impulses change with the \nadvance of age. When the limited period of infancy ends and the infant’s \ntemperament changes, he does not like to even look at what was so familiar to him \nbut rather turns his face from it in disgust. But, the love of prophets and saints for \nunion with Allah is mental and spiritual and mental and spiritual feelings do not \nchange, nor does weakness or decay occur in them. Since death is the means and \nfirst rung toward this goal, their love for death increases to such an extent that its \nrigors become the cause of pleasure for them and its bitterness proves to be the \nsource of delight for their taste. Their love for it is the same as that of the thirsty for \nthe well or that of a lost passenger for his goal. Thus, when Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nwas wounded by Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muljim’s fatal attack, he said, “I was but like \nthe walker who has reached (the goal) or like the seeker who has found (his object) \nand whatever is with Allah is good for the pious. The Prophet (h) also said that \nthere is no pleasure for a believer other than union with Allah. \nthe disturbances, he rose to face the enemy. Similarly, Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x), treating the life of the Prophet (h) as a torch for his guidance, \nrefrained from exhibiting the power of his arm because he was realizing \nthat rising against the enemy without helpers and supporter would become \na source of rebellion and defeat instead of success and victory. Therefore, \non this occasion, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has likened the desire for \nCaliphate to turbid water or a morsel suffocating the throat. Thus, even \nwhere people had forcibly snatched this morsel and wanted to swallow it \nby forcible thrusting, it got stuck in their throat. They could neither \nswallow it nor vomit it out. That is, they could neither manage it as is \napparent from the blunders they committed in connection with Islamic \ninjunctions, nor were they ready to cast off the knot from their neck. \n \nHe reiterated the same ideas in different words thus; “Had I \nattempted to pluck the unripe fruit of Caliphate, then by this the orchard \nwould have been desolated and I, too, would have achieved nothing, like \nthese people who cultivate on other’s land but can neither guard it, nor \nwater it at the proper time, nor reap any crop from it. The status of these \npeople is that if I ask them to vacate it so that the owner should cultivate it \nhimself and protect it, they say how greedy I am, while if I keep quiet \nthey think I am afraid of death. They should tell me on what occasion did \nI ever feel afraid, or flew from a battlefield for my life, whereas every \nsmall or big encounter is proof of my bravery and a witness to may daring \nand courage. He who plays with swords and strikes against hillocks is not \nafraid of death. I am so familiar with death that even an infant is not so \nfamiliar with the breast of its mother. Hark! The reason for my silence is \nthe knowledge that the Prophet (h) has put in my bosom. If I divulge it \nyou would get perplexed and bewildered. Let some days pass and you \nwould know the reason of my inaction and perceive with your own eyes \nwhat sort of people would appear on this scene under the name of Islam \nand what destruction they would bring about. My silence is because this \nwould happen, otherwise, it is not silence without reason.” \n \nA Persian axiom says the following: “Silence has a meaning \nwhich cannot be couched in words.”"

Now, so long as I have the breath of life, I shall fight them and make them \nsuffer the consequences of their conduct. They should not think that I can be easy \nover-powered like the badger. Its nicknames are: “Umm Amir” and “Umm Tariq”. \nIt is also called “the glutton” because it swallows everything and eats up whatever it \ngets as if several bellies were contained in one and it does not have its fill. It is also \ncalled Na`thal. It is a very simply and silly animal. Its slyness is apparent from the \nway it is easily caught. It is said that the hunter surrounds its den and strikes it with \nhis foot or a stick and calls out softly, ABow your head, Umm Tariq, conceal \nyourself, Umm Amir. On repeating this sentence, while patting the ground, it \nconceals itself in a corner of the den. Then, the hunter says, “Umm Amir is not in \nits den; it is sleeping.” On hearing this, it stretches its limbs and pretends it is \nasleep. The hunter then puts the knot in its feet and drags it out and it falls like a \ncoward into his hand without resistance. \n122Amir al-Mu’minin (x) says about the hypocrites (i.e. Those who opposed him \nbefore the during his Caliphate) that they are partners in action of Satan and his \nhelpers and supporters. He too, has befriended them so much that he has made his \nabode with them, resides on their bosoms, lays eggs and hatches young one from \nbosoms. He creeps and crawls in their laps. He sees through their eyes \nand speaks with their tongues. In this way, he has led them to sinfulness \nand adorned for them foul things like the action of one whom Satan has \nmade partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue."

He \nmeans that Satanic evil ideas take birth in their bosoms and grow and thrive the re. \nThere is no restrain on them, nor restriction of any kind.

Now, \nthe eyes are theirs but the sight is his, the tongue is theirs but he words are his and \nthe Prophet (h) has said, “Verily, Stan permeates the progeny of Adam like blood. \nThat is, just as the circulation of blood does not stop, the same way, the quick \nsuccession of Satan’s evil ideas knows no break and he draws man toward evil in \nsleep in wakefulness and in every posture, rising or sitting. He so paints them with \nhis dye that their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word and action. \nThose whose bosoms shine with the glory of faith prevent such evil ideas but some \nare already ready to welcome those evils and these are the persons who, under the \ngarb of Islam, are after the advancement of heresy. \n123After swearing allegiance on the hand of Amir al-Mu’minin (x), az-\nZubayr ibn al-Awwam broke the allegiance. Then sometimes he put forth the \nexcuse that he was forced to swear allegiance and that forced allegiance is no \nallegiance and sometimes, he said that allegiance was only for show. His heart did \nnot go in accord to it. As though he himself admitted with his tongue the duplicity \nof his outer appearance and inner self. But this excuse is like that of the one who \nreverts to apostasy after adopting Islam and to avoid penalty may say that he had \naccepted Islam only by the tongue, not in the heart. Obviously, such an excuse \ncannot be heard nor can avoid punishment. If az-Zubayr suspected that Othman was \nslain at insistence of Amir al-Mu’minin, this suspicion should have existed when he \nwas taking the oath for obedience and stretching his hand for allegiance, not now \nthat his expectations were getting frustrated and hopes had started dawning from \nsomewhere else."

    "text": "Delivered during the Battle of Jamal when Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) gave the standard to his son Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya \n \nMountains 2 may move from their status, but you should not \nmove from yours. Grit your teeth. Lend to Allah your head (in fighting for \nAllah, give yourself to Allah). Plant your feet firmly on the ground. Have \nyour eye on the remotest foe and close your eyes (to their numberical \nmajority). And be sure that succor is but from Allah, the Glorified. \n \nMuhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya was Amir al-Mu’minin’s son but \ncalled Ibn Hanafiyya after his mother. His mother’s name was Khawla \ndaughter of Ja`far. She was known as Hanafiyya after her tribe Banu \nHanifah. When people of Yamama were declared, “postates for refusing \nto pay zakat (religious tax) and were killed and the women were brought \nto Medina as slave girls, this lady also came to Medina with them. When \nher tribesmen came to know it they approached Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nand requested him to save her from the blemish of slavery and protect her \nfamily honor and prestige. Consequently, Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\npurchased her, set her free and married her where after, Muhammad (h)\nwas born. \n \nMost historians have written his surname as Abul-Qasim. Thus, \nthe author of Al-Isti’ab (Vol. 3. pp. 1366-1368, 1370-1372) has narrated \nthe opinion of Abu Rashd ibn Hafs az-Zuhri that from among the sons of \nthe companions (of the Prophet [h]) he came across four individuals \neveryone of whom was named Muhammad and surnamed Abul-Qasim, \nnamely (1) Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, (2) Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr \n(3) Muhammad ibn Talhah and (4) Muhammad ibn Sa`d. After this he \nwrites that Muhammad ibn Talhah’s name and surname were given by the \nProphet (h). Al-Waqidi writes that the name of surname of Muhammad \nibn Abu Bakr was suggested by Aisha. Apparently the Holy Prophet’s \ngiving the name of Muhammad ibn Talhah seems incorrect since from \nsome traditions it appears that the Prophet (h) had reserved it for a son of \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) and he was Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. \nAs regarding his surname it is said that the Prophet (h) had \nparticularized it and that he had told Ali that a son would be born to you \nafter me and I have given him my name and surname and after that it is \nnot permissible for anyone in my people to have this name and surname \ntogether.\n \nWith this opinion before us, how can it be correct that the Prophet \n(h) had given this very name and surname to anyone else since \nparticularization means that no one else would share it. Moreover, some \npeople have recorded the surname of Ibn Talhah as Abu Sulayman instead \nof Abul-Qasim and this further confirms our viewpoint. Similarly, if the \nsurname of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was on the ground that his son’s \nname was Qasim, who was among the theologians of Medians, then what \nis the sense in Aisha having suggested it. If she had suggested it along \nwith the name, how could Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr tolerate it later on \nsince having been brought up under the care of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) the \nProphet’s saying could not remain concealed form him. Moreover, most \npeople have recorded his surname as Abu Abd ar-Rahman, which \nweakens the view of Abu Rashid. \n \nLet alone these people’s surname being Abul-Qoim, even for ibn \nal-Hanafiyya this surname is not proved. Although ibn Khallikan (in \nWafiyyat al-A’yan, Vol. 4, p. 170) has taken that some of Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) for whom the Prophet (h) had particularized this surname \nto be Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, yet allama al-Mamaqani (in Tanqih \nal-Maqal, Vol. 3, Part 1, p. 112) writes the following: \n \nIn applying this tradition to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, Ibn \nKhallikan has got into confusion because the son of Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) whom the Prophet’s name and surname together have been gifted by \nthe Prophet (h) and which is not permissible to be given to any one else, \nis to the awaited last Imam (may our lives be his ransom) and not to \nMuhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, nor is the surname Abul-Qasim established \nfor him, rather some of the Sunnis being ignorant of the real intention of \nthe Prophet (h), have taken to mean Ibn al-Hanafiyya. \n \nHowever, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya was prominent in \nrighteousness and piety, sublime in renunciation and worship, lofty in \nknowledge and achievements and heir of his father in bravery. His \nperformance in the Battle of Jamal and Siffin had created such impression \namong the Arabs that even warriors of consequence trembled at this \nname. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) too was proud of his courage and valor and \nalways placed him forward in encounters. Shaikh al-Baha’i has written in \nal-Kashkul that Ali ibn Abu Talib kept him abreast in the battles and did \nnot allow Hassan and Hussain to go ahead and used to say, “He is my son \nwhile these two are sons of the Prophet of Allah (k). When a Kharijite \nsaid to ibn al-Hanafiyya that Ali thrust him into the flames of war but \nsaved away Hassan and Hussain (x), he replied that he himself was like \nthe right hand and Hassan and Hussain (x) like Ali’s two eyes and that Ali \nprotected his eyes with his right hand. But Allama al-Mamaqani has \nwritten in Tanqih al-Maqal that his was not the reply of Ibn al-Hanafiyya, \nbut of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) himself. When during the battle of Siffin \nMuhammad mentioned this matter to Amir al-Mu’minin (x) in a \ncomplaining tone, he replied, “You are my right hand whereas they are \nmy eyes and the hand should protect the eyes. \n \nApparently it seems that first Amir al-Mu’minin (x) must have \ngiven this reply and thereafter someone might have mentioned it to \nMuhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya and he must have repeated the same reply \nas there could not be a more eloquent reply than this one and its \neloquence confirms the view that it was originally the outcome of the \neloquent tongue of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) and was later appropriated by \nMuhammad (h) al-Hanafiyya. Consequently, both these views can be \nheld to be correct and there is no incongruity between them. However, he \nwas bo5rn in the reign of the second Caliph and died in the reign of \nAbdul-Malik ibn Marwan at the age of sixty-five years. Some writers \nhave recorded the year of his death as 80 A.H. And others as 81 A.H. \nThere is a difference about the place of his death as well. Some have put it \nas Medina, some Aylah and some Ta’if. \n \n2. When in the Battle of Jamal Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent \nMuhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya to the battle field, he told him that he \nshould fix himself before the enemy like the mountain of determination \nand resolution so that the onslaught of the army should not be able to \ndisplace him and he should charge the enemy with closed teeth because \nby pressing the teeth over the teeth, tension occurs in the nerves of the \nskull. As a result of which the stroke of the sword goes amiss as he said at \nanother place, “Press together your teeth. It sends amiss the edge of the \nsword.” Then he says, “My child, lend your head to Allih in order that \nyou may be able to achieve eternal life in place of this one because for a \nlent article there is the right to get it back. Therefore, you should fight \nbeing heedless of your life; otherwise, also if your mind clings to life, you \nwill hesitate to advance toward deathly encounters and that would fall \nupon your reputation of bravery. Look, do not let your steps falter because \nthe enemy is emboldened at the faltering of steps and faltering steps \nfastens the feet of the enemy. Keep the last lines of the enemy as your aim \nso that the enemy may be overawed with loftiness of your intentions and \nyou may feel ease in tearing through their lives and their movement \nshould also not remain concealed form you. Look, do not pay heed to \ntheir superiority in numbers, otherwise, your valor and courage would \nsuffer.” This statement can also mean that one should open the eyes wide \nto be dazzled by the shining of weapons and the enemy may make at \nattack by taking advantage of the situation. Also, always bear in mind that \nvictory is from Allah. “If Allah helps you, no one can overpower you.” \nTherefore, instead of relying on material means, seek His support and \nsuccor."

It was then that Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) asked him, “Did you brother hold me as a friend?” The \ncomrade said, “Yes.” Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said, “In that case, he was \nwith us.

Your character is low and your pledge is \nbroken. Your faith is hypocrisy. Your water is brackish. He who stays \nwith you is laden with sins and he who forsakes you secures Allah’s \nmercy. As though I see your mosque prominent, resembling the surface of \na boat, while Allah has sent chastisement from above and from below it \nand everyone who is on it is drowned. \nAnother version of the same sermon: \n \nBy Allah! Your city would certainly be drowned so much so that \nas though I see its mosque like the upper part of a boat or a sitting ostrich \n(or, in another version of his statement) like the bosom of a bird in the \ndeep sea.\nYet Another Version States the Following: \n \nYour city is the most stinking of all the cities as regarding its \nclay, the nearest to water and remotest from the sky. It contains nine \ntenths of evil. He who enters it is surrounded with his sins and he who is \nout of it enjoys Allah’s forgiveness. It seems as though I look at this \nhabitation of yours that water has so engulfed it that nothing can be seen \nof it except the highest part of the mosque appearing like the bosom of a \nbird in the deep sea. \n \nIbn Maytham writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended, three \ndays thereafter, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said the morning prayer in the \ncentral mosque of Basra. After finished it he stood on the right side of the \nprayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this sermon wherein \nhe described the lowness of character of the people of Basra and they \nslyness, namely that they got inflamed at others’ instigation without \nanyone of their own and making over their command to a woman clung to \na camel. They broke away after swearing allegiance and exhibited their \nlow character and evil nature by being double-faced. In this sermon, the \nwoman implies Aisha and the quadruped implies the camel (Jamal) after \nwhich this battle has been named the Battle of the Jamal. This battle \noriginated in this way. During the lifetime of Othman, Aisha used to \noppose him and had left for Mecca leaving him in siege and as such, she \nhad a share in his assassination details of which would be stated at some \nsuitable place but when on her return from Mecca toward Medina, she \nheard from Abdullah ibn Salamah that Othman’s allegiance had been paid \nto Ali (as Caliph) she suddenly exclaimed, “If allegiance has been paid to \nAli, I wish the sky had burst on the earth. Let me go back to Mecca.” \nConsequently, she decided to return to Mecca and began saying, “By \nAllah, Othman has been helplessly killed. I shall certainly avenge his \nblood.” On seeing this wide change in the state of affairs, Abu Salamah \nsaid, “What are you saying as you yourself used to say ‘Kill this Na’thal; \nhe had turned unbeliever’.” Thereupon, she replied, “Not only I but \neveryone used to say so; but leave these things and listen to what I am \nnow saying, that is better and deserves more attention. It is so strange that \nfirst he was called upon to repent but before giving him an opportunity to \ndo so, he has been killed.” On this Abu Salamah recited the following \nverses addressing her: \n \nYou started it and now you are changing and raising storms of \nwind and rain. You ordered for his killing and told us that he had turned \nunbeliever. We admit that he has been killed but under your orders and \nthe real killer is the one who ordered it. Nevertheless, neither the sky fell \nover us not did the sun and moon fall into eclipse. Certainly people have \npaid allegiance to one who can ward off the enemy with power and \ngrandeur, does not allow swords to come near him and loosens the twist \nof the rope, that is, subdues his enemy. He is always fully armed for \ncombat and the faithful is never like the traitor. \n \nHowever, when she reached Mecca with a passion for vengeance \nshe began rousing the people to avenge Othman’s blood by circulating \nstories of his having been victimized. The first to respond to this call was \nAbdullah ibn Amir al-Hadrami, who had been the governor of Mecca in \nOthman’s reign and with him Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Sa’id ibn al-As and \nother Umayyads rose to support her. On the other side, Talhah ibn \nUbaydillah and az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam also reached Mecca from \nMedina. From Yemen Ya`li ibn Munabbih who had been governor there \nduring Othman’s caliphate and the former governor of Basra, Abdullah \nibn Amir ibn Kurayz also reached there and joining together began \npreparing their plans. The battle had been decided upon but the discussion \nwas about he venue of confrontation. Aisha’s opinion was to make \nMedina the venue of the battle but some people opposed and held that it \nwas difficult to deal with Medinites and that some other place should be \nchose as the venue. At last after much discussion it was decided to march \ntowards Basra as there was no dearth of men to support the cause. \nConsequently on the strength of Abdullah ibn Amir’s countless wealth \nand the offer of six hundred thousand Dirhams and six hundred camels by \nYa`li ibn Munabbih they prepared any army of three thousand and set off \nto Basra. There was a small incident on the way of account of which \nAisha refused to advance further. What happened was that at a place she \nheard the barking of dogs and inquired from the camel driver the name of \nthe place. He said it was Haw’ab. On hearing this name, she recalled the \nProphet’s admonition when he ha said to his wives, AI wish I could know \nat which of you the dogs of Haw’ab would bark. So when she realized \nthat she herself was the one, she got the camel seated by patting and \nexpressed her intention to abandon themarch. But the device of her \ncompanions saved the deteriorating situation. Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr \nswore to assure her that it was not Haw’ab, Talhah seconded him and for \nher further assurance, also sent for fifty persons to testify to it. When all \nof the people were on one side, what could a single woman do by \nopposing. Eventually they were successful and Aisha resumed her \nforward march with the same enthusiasm. \n \nWhen this army reached Basra, people were first amazed to see \nthe riding animal of Aisha. Jariyah ibn Qudamah came forward and said, \n“O, Mother of the faithful, the assassination of `Othman was one tragedy \nbut the greater tragedy is that you have come out on this cursed camel and \nruined your honor and esteem. It is better that you should get back. But \nsince neither the incident at Haw’ab could deter her nor could the Quranic \ninjunction: “Keep sitting in your houses (33: 33) stop her,” what effect \ncould these voices produce. Consequently, she disregarded all of this. \n \nWhen the army tried to enter the city, the governor of Basra \nOthman ibn Hunayf came forward to stop them and when the two parties \ncame face-to-face, they drew their swords out of the sheaths and pounced \nupon each other. When a good number had been killed from either side, \nAisha intervened on the basis of her influence and the two groups agreed \nthat until the arrival of Amir al-Mu’minin (x), the existing administration \nshould continue and Othman ibn Hunayf should continue on his post. But \nonly two days had elapsed when they made a nightly attack on Othman \nibn Hunayf, killed forty innocent persons, beat Othman ibn Hunayf, \nplucked every hair of his bread, took him in their custody and shut him u, \np. Then they attacked the public treasury and while ransacking it, killed \ntwenty persons on the spot and beheaded fifty more after arresting them. \nThen they attacked the grain store whereupon an elderly noble of Basra, \nHukaym ibn Jabalah, could not control himself and reaching there with \nhis men said to Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, ASpare some of this grain for the \ncity’s populace. After all there should be a limit to oppression. You have \nspread killing and destruction all around and put Othman ibn Hunayf in \nconfinement. For Allah’s sake, keep off these ruining activities and \nrelease Othman ibn Hunayf. Is there no fear of Allah in your hearts? ibn \naz-Zubayr said, “This is vengeance of Othman’s life. Hukaym ibn Jabalah \nretorted, AWere those who have been killed assassins of Othman? By \nAllah, if I had supporters and comrades I should have certainly avenged \nthe blood of these Muslims whom you have killed without reason. Ibn az-\nZubayr replied, “We shall not give anything out of this grain, nor will \nOthman ibn Hunayf be released. At last, the battle raged between these \ntwo parties but how could a few individuals deal with such a big force? \nthe result was the Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his son al-Ashraf ibn Hukaym ibn \nJabalah, his brother ar-Ri’l ibn Jabalah and seventy persons of his tribe \nwere killed. In short, killing and looting prevailed all around. Neither \nanyone’s life was secure nor was there any way to save one’ honor or \nproperty. \n \nWhen Amir al-Mu’minin (x) was informed of themarch to Basra, \nhe set out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of those who \nhad taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of those \ncompanions who had the honor of being present at the Allegiance of \nRidwan (The Divine Pleasure). When he stopped at the stage of Khaqar, \nhe sent his son Hassan (x) and “`Ammar ibn Yasir to Kufa to invite its \npeople to fighting.” Consequently, despite interference of Abu Musa al-\nAsh`ari seven thousand combatants from there joined Amir al-\nMu’minin’s army. He left that place after placing the army under various \ncommanders. Eye witnesses state that when his force reached near Basra \nfirst of all a contingent of Ansar appeared foremost. Its standard was held \nby Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After it appeared, another contingent of 1,000 \nwhose commander was Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari. Then another \ncontingent came in sight. Its standard was borne by Abu Qatadah ibn ar-\nRabi’. Then a crowd of a thousand old and young persons was seen. They \nhad signs of prostration on their foreheads and veils of fear of Allah on \ntheir face. It seemed as if they were standing before the Divine Glory of \nthe Day of Judgment. Their commander rode a dark horse, was dressed in \nwhite, had a black turban on his head and was reciting the Holy Quran \nloudly. This was `Ammar ibn Yasir. Then another contingent appeared. \nIts standard was in the hand of Qays ibn Sa`d ibn Abadah. Then an army \ncame to sight. Its leader wore white outfit and hade a black turban on this \nhead. He was so handsome that all eyes centered around him. This was \nAbdullah ibn Abbas. Then followed a contingent of the companions of the \nProphet (h). Their standard bearer was Othman ibn Abbas. Then after \nthe passing of a few contingents, a big crowd was seen wherein there was \nsuch a large number of spears that they were overlapping and flags of \nnumerous colors were flying. Among them, a big and lofty standard was \nseen with a distinctive status. Behind it was seen a rider guarded by \nsublimity and greatness. His sinews were well-developed and his eyes \nwere cast downwards. His awe and dignity was such that no one could \nlook at him. This was the ever victorious Lion of Allah namely Ali, Ibn \nAbu Talib (x). On his right and left were Hassan and Hussain (peace be \nupon them). In front of him Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya walked in slow \nsteps carrying the banner of victory and glory and on the back were young \nmen of Banu Hashim, the people of Badr and `Abdullah ibn Ja`far ibn \nAbu Talib. When this army reached the place az-Zawiyah, Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) alighted from the horse. After performing a four rak’at \nprayer, he put his cheeks on the ground. When he lifted his head, the \nground was drenched with tears and his tongue was uttering these words: \nO Sustainer of earth, heaven and the high firmament! \nThis is Basra. Fill our lap with its good and protect us \nfrom its evil. \n \nThen proceeding forward he got down in the battlefield of Jamal \nwhere the enemy was already camping. First of all, Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nannounced in his army that no one should attack another nor take the \ninitiative. Saying this he came in front of the opposite army and said to \nTalhah and az-Zubayr, “You ask Aisha by swearing in the name of Allah \nand His Prophet (h) whether I am not free from the blame of Othman’s \nblood and whether I used the same words for him which you used to say \nand whether I pressed you for allegiance or you swore it of your own free \nwill.” Talhah got exasperated at these words but az-Zubayr relented. Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) turned back after it and giving the Holy Quran to Muslim \n(a young man from the tribe of Abd Qays sent him toward them to \npronounce to them the verdict of the Holy Quran. But people took both of \nthem within aim and covered this godly man with their arrows. Then \nAmmar ibn Yasir went to canvass and convince them and caution them \nwith the consequences of war but his words were also replied by arrows. \nUntil now, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) had not allowed an attack as a result of \nwhich the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went on raining \narrows constantly. At last, with the dying of a few valiant combatants \nconsternation was created among Amir al-Mu’minin’s ranks and some \npeople came with a few bodies before him and said, “O Commander of \nthe Faithful! You are not allowing us to fight while they are covering us \nwith arrows. How long can we let them make our bosoms the victim of \ntheir arrows and remain hand folded at their excesses? At this, Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) did show anger but acting with restraint and endurance \ncame to the enemy in that very form without wearing armor or any arm \nand shouted, “Where is az-Zubayr?!” At first az-Zubayr hesitated to come \nforward but he noticed that Amir al-Mu’minin (x) had no arms so he \ncame out. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said to him “O az-Zubayr! You must \nremember that one day the Prophet (h) told you that you would fight \nwith me and wrong and excess would be on your side.” Az-Zubayr \nreplied that he had said so. Then Amir al-Mu’minin (x) inquired AWhy \nhave you come then?” He replied that his memory had missed it and if he \nhad recollected it earlier he would not have come that way. Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) said, “Well now you have recollected it” and he replied, \n“Yes.” Saying this he went straight to Aisha and told her that he was \nleaving. She asked him the reason and he replied, “Ali has reminded me a \nforgotten matter. I had gone astray, but now I have come on the right path \nand would not fight Ali ibn Abu Talib at any cost.” Aisha said, “You have \ncaught the fear of the swords of the sons of `Abdul-Muttalib.” He said, \n“No” and saying this, he turned the reins of his horse. However, it is \ngratifying that some consideration was accorded to the Prophet’s saying, \nfor at Haw’ab even after recollection of the Prophet’s words no more than \na transient effect was taken of it. On returning after this conversation, \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) observed that they had attacked the right and left \nflanks of his army.” Noticing this, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said, “Now the \nplea has been exhausted. Call my son Muhammad.” When he came Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) said, “My son, attack them now. Muhammad bowed his \nhead and taking the standard proceeded to the battlefield.” But arrows \nwere falling in such exuberance that he had to stop. When Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) saw this, he called out at him, “Muhammad! Why do not \nyou advance?” He said, “Father, in this shower of arrows, there is not way \nto proceed. I will wait till the violence of arrows subsides.” The Imam (x)\nsaid, “No, thrust yourself in the arrows and spears and attack.” \nMuhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya advanced a little but the archers so \nsurrounded him that he had to hold his steps. On seeing this a frown \nappeared on Amir al-Mu’minin’s forehead and said, “This is the affect of \nyour mother’s veins. Saying this he took the standard from his hands and \nfolded up his sleeves and made such an attack that a tumult was created in \nthe enemy’ ranks from one end to the other. To which ever row he turned, \nit became clear and to whatever side he directed himself, bodies were \nseen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses. When after \nconvulsing the rows, he returned to his status and said to Muhammad ibn \nal-Hanafiyya, “Look, my son! Battles are fought like this.” Saying this, he \ngave the standard to him and ordered him to proceed. Muhammad \nadvanced toward the enemy with a contingent of Ansar. The enemy also \ncame out moving and balancing their spears. But the brave son of the \nvaliant father convulsed rows over rows while the other warriors made the \nbattlefield glory and left heaps of dead bodies. \n \nFrom the other side, there was a full demonstration of the spirit of \nsacrifice. Dead bodies were falling one over the other, but they continued \nsacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel. Particularly, the \ncondition of Banu Dabbah was that although their hands were being \nsevered from the elbows for holding the reins of the camel and bosoms \nwere being pierced yet they had the following battle song on their \ntongues:\nTo us, death is sweeter than honey. We are Banu Dabbah, camel \nrearers. We are sons of death when death comes. We announce the death \nof Othman with the edges of spears. Give us back our chief and there is an \nend to it. \n \nThe low character and ignorance from faith of these Banu Dabbah \ncan be well understood by that one incident which al-Mada’ini has \nnarrated. He writes that in Basra there was a man with a mutilated ear. He \nasked him its reason when he said, “I was watching the sight of dead \nbodies in the battlefield of Jamal when I saw a wounded man who \nsometimes raised his head and sometimes dashed it back on the ground. I \napproached near.” Then, the following two verses were on his lips: \n \nOur mother pushed us into the deep waters of death and did not \nget back till we had thoroughly drunk. \n \nBy misfortune, we obeyed. Banu Taym who are none but slave \nmen and slave girls. \n \nI told him it was not the time to recite verses; he should rather \nrecall Allah and recite the kalima (shahada) (verse of testimony). On my \nsaying this he gave me an angry look and uttering a sever abuse said, \n“You are asking me to recite the kalima, get frightened at the last moment \nand show impatience? I was astonished to hear this and decided to return \nwithout saying anything further. When he saw me returned he said, “Wait, \nfor your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach me. I drew close to teach \nhim the kalima when he asked me to get closer. When I got closer, he \ncaught my ear with his teeth and did not leave it till he tore it from the \nroot. I did not think it proper to assault a dying man and was about to get \nback abusing and cursing him when he asked me to listen to one more \nthing. I agreed to listen lest he had an unsatisfied wish. He said that when \nI should get to my mother and she inquired who had bitten my ear, I \nshould say that it was done by `Umayr ibn al-Ahlab ad-Dabbi who had \nbeen deceived by a woman aspiring to become the commander of the \nfaithful (head of state). \n \nHowever, when the dazzling lightning of swords finished the \nlives of thousand of persons and hundreds of Banu Azd and Banu Dabbah \nwere killed for holding the rein of the camel. Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nordered, “Kill the camel, for it is Satan.” Saying this, he made such a \nsevere attack that the cries of ‘Peace!’ and ‘Protection!’ rose from all \naround. When he reached near the camel he ordered Bujayr ibn Buljah to \nkill the camel at once. Consequently, Bujayr hit it with such might that \nthe camel fell in agony on the side of its bosom. No sooner than the camel \nfell, the opposite army took to heels and the carrier holding Aisha was left \nlonely and unguarded. The companions of Amir la-Mu’minin took control \nof the carrier and under orders of Amir al-Mu’minin (x), Muhammad ibn \nAbu Bakr escorted Aisha to the house of Safiyya daughter of al-Harith. \n \nThis encounter commenced on the 10th of Jumada II, 36 A.H. in \nthe afternoon and came to and end the same evening. In it from Amir al-\nMu’minn’s army of twenty two thousand, one thousand and seventy or \naccording to another version, five hundred persons were killed as martyrs \nwhile from Aisha’s army of thirty thousand, seventeen thousand persons \nwere killed and the Prophet’s saying, “That people who assigned their \naffairs (of state) to a woman would never prosper was fully corroborated.” \n(Al-Imama wal-Siyasa; Muruj al-Dhahab; al-`Iqd al-Farid; al-Tabari’s \nTarikh).\n \n2. Ibn Abul-Hadid has written that as prophesied by Amir al-\nMu’minin (x), Basra got under the floods twice, once during the days of \nal-Qadir Billah, and once during the reign of al-Qa’im bi Amrillah. The \ncondition of flooding was such that the whole city was submerged, but the \ntop ends of the mosque were seen about in the surface of the water and \nlooked like a bird encroaching on its bosom’s side."

    "text": "Delivered When Allegiance Was Sworn to Him at Medina \n \nThe responsibility for what I say is guaranteed and I am \nanswerable for it. He to whom experiences have clearly shown the past \nexemplary punishments (given by Allah to people) is prevented by piety \nfrom falling into doubts. You should know that the same troubles have \nreturned to you which existed when the Prophet (h) was first sent. \n \nBy Allah Who sent the Prophet (h) with faith and truth! You \nwill be severely subverted, bitterly shaken s in sieving and fully mixed as \nby spooning in a cooking pot till your low persons become high and high \nones become low, those who were behind would attain forward positions \nand those who were forward would become backward. By Allah, I have \nnot concealed a single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of \nthis event and of this time. \n \nBeware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have \nbeen placed and their reins have been let loose so that they would jump \nwith them in Hell. Beware that piety is like trained horses on whom the \nriders have been placed with the reins in the hands so that they would take \nthe riders to Heaven. There is right and wrong and there are followers for \neach. If wrong dominates, it has (always) in the past been so and if truth \ngoes down that too has often occurred. It seldom happens that a thing that \nlags behind comes forward. \n \nAsh-Sharif ar-Radi says the following by way of commenting on \nthe above: “In the short speech, there is more beauty than can be \nappreciated and the quantity of amazement aroused by it is more than can \nbe appreciated. Despite what we have stated, it has so many aspects of \neloquence that cannot be expressed, nor can anyone reach its depth. And \nno one can understand what I am saying unless one has attained this are \nand known its details.” \nNo one appreciates it except those who know (Holy Quran, 29: 43) \nFrom the Same Sermon: \n \nHe who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim. He who \nattempts and acts quickly succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may \nalso entertain hope. And he who falls short of actions faces destruction in \nHell. On the right and left there are misleading paths. Only the middle \nway if the (right) path which is the Everlasting book and the traditions of \nthe Prophet (h). From it the Sunnah has spread out and toward it is the \neventual return. \n \nHe who claims (otherwise) is ruined and he who concocts \nfalsehood is disappointed. He who opposes1 the right with his face gets \ndestruction. It is enough ignorance for a man not to know himself. He \nwho is strong rooted2 in piety does not get destruction and the plantation \nof the people based on piety never remains without water. Hide \nyourselves in your houses and reform yourselves. Repentance is at your \nback. One should praise only Allah and condemn only his own self. \n \nIn some versions of this same sermon, after the words man abda \nsafhatahu lilhaqqi halaka, the words inda jahalatu’n-nas also occur. In tat \ncase, the meaning of this sentence would be that he who stands in the face \nof right dies in the estimation of the ignorant. \n \nPiety is the connotation of the heart and the mind being affected \nand impressed by the Divine Greatness and Gory. As an effect of it, the \nspirit of man becomes full of the fear of Allah and its inevitable result is \nthat engrossment in worship and prayers increases. It is impossible that \nthe heart may be full of the Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it \nin actions and deeds. And since worship and submission reform the heart \nand nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with the increase of \nworship. That is why in the Holy Quran, Ataqwa (piety) has been applied \nsometimes to fear, in the verse, Ittaqul-laha haqqa tuqatihi (worship Allah \nas He ought to be worshipped) (3: 102). Taqwa implies worship and \ndevotion, and in the verse wa yakhsha’l-laha wa yattaqhi faullaika humul \nfaizun (24: 52) taqwa implies purity of the spirit and cleanliness of the \nheart.\n \nIn the traditions, taqwa has been assigned three degrees. The first \ndegree is that a man should follow the injunctions and keep aloof from \nprohibitions. The second degree is that recommended matters should also \nbe followed and disliked things should be avoided. The third degree is \nthat for fear of falling into doubts, one may abstain from the permissible \nas well. The first degree is for the common men, the second for the nobles \nand the third for the high dignitaries. Allah has referred to these three \ndegrees in the following verse: \nOn those who believe and do good, is not blame for what they \nate (before) when they did guard themselves and did believe and did \ngood, still (furthermore) they guard themselves and do good, and Allah \nloves the doers of good. (Holy Quran, 5: 93) \n \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) says that only action based on piety is \nlasting and only that action will blossom and bear fruit which is watered \nby piety because worship is only that wherein the feeling of \nsubmissiveness exists. Thus, Allah says the following: \nIs he, therefore, better who has laid his foundation on fear of \nAllah and (His) goodwill or he who lays his foundation on the brink of a \ncrumbling bank so it broke down with him into the fire of hell?(Holy \nQuran 9: 109) \n \nConsequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and \nconviction is like the edifice, erected without foundation, wherein there is \nno stability or firmness while every action that is without piety is like the \nplantation which withers because of not being watered."

    "text": "About Those Who Sit for Dispensation of Justice among \nPeople but Are Not Fit for It\n \nAmong all the people, the most detested before Allah are two \npersons. One is he who is devoted to his self. So he is deviated from the \ntrue path and loves speaking about (foul) innovations and inviting toward \nthe wrong path. He is, therefore, a nuisance for those who are enamored \nof him, is himself misled from the guidance of those enamored of him, is \nhimself misled from the guidance of those preceding him, misleads those \nwho follow him in his life or after his death, carries the weight of others’ \nsins and is entangled in his own misdeeds. \n \nThe other man is he who has picked up ignorance. He moves \namong the ignorant, is senseless in the thick of mischief and is blind to \nthe advantages of peace. Those resembling like men have named him \nscholar but he is not so. He goes out early morning to collect things \nwhose deficiency is better than plenty, till when he has quenched his thirst \nform polluted water and acquired meaningless things. \n \nHe sits among the people as a judge responsible for solving \nwhatever is confusing to the others. If an ambiguous problem is presented \nbefore him he manages a shabby argument about it of his own accord and \npasses judgment on its basis. In this way, he is entangled in the confusion \nof doubts as in the spider’s web, not knowing whether he was right or \nwrong. If he is right, he fears lest he errs, while if he is wrong, he hopes \nhe is right. He is ignorant, wandering astray in ignorance and riding on \ncarriages aimlessly moving in darkness. He does not try to find the reality \nof knowledge. He scatters the traditions as the wind scatters the dry \nleaves.\n \nBy Allah! He is not capable of solving the problems that come to \nhim nor is he fit of the status assigned to him. Whatever he does not know \nhe doses not regard it worth knowing. He does not realize that what is \nbeyond his reach is within the reach of others. If anything is not clear to \nhim, he keeps quiet over it because he knows his own ignorance. Lost \nlives are crying against his unjust verdicts and properties (that have been \nwrongly disposed of) are grumbling against him. \n \nI complain to Allah about persons who live ignorant and die \nmisguided. For them nothing is more worthless than Holy Quran if it is \nrecited as it should be recited, nor anything more valuable than the Holy \nQuran if is verses are removed from their places, nor anything more \nvicious than virtue nor more virtuous than vice. \n \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) has held two categories of persons as the \nmost detestable by Allah and the worst among people. Firstly, those who \nare misguided even in basic tenets and are busy in the spreading of evil. \nSecondly, those who abandon the Holy Quran and Sunnah and pronounce \ninjunctions through their imagination. They create a circle of their \ndevotees and popularize the religious code of law concocted by \nthemselves. The misguidance and wrongfulness of such persons does not \nremain confined to their own selves but the seed of misguidance sown by \nthem bears fruit and, growing into the form of a big tree, provides an \nasylum to the misguided. This misguidance goes on multiplying. And \nsince these very people are the real originators, the weight of other’s sins \nis also on their shoulders as the Holy Quran says the following: \nAnd certainly, they shall bear their own burdens and (others’) \nburdens with their own burdens.

    "text": "1 Amir Al-Mu’minin (x) Said in Disparagement of the \nDifferences of Views among the Theologians \n \nWhen a problem is put before anyone of them he passes judgment \non it from his imagination. When exactly the same problem is placed \nbefore another of them he passes an opposite verdict. Then these judges \ngo to the chief who had appointed them and he confirms all the verdicts, \nalthough their Allah is One (and the same), their Prophet (h) is one (and \nthe same), their Book (the Holy Quran), is one (and the same). \n \nIs it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him? Or \nHe prohibited them from it but hey disobeyed Him? Or (is it that) Allah \nsent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to complete it? Or they are \nHis partners in the affairs so that it is their share of duty to pronounce and \nHe as to agree? Or is it that Allah, the most Glorified One, sent a perfect \nfaith but the Prophet (h) fell short of conveying it and handing it over (to \nthe people) ? the fact is that Allah, the most Glorified One, says the \nfollowing:\nWe have not neglected anything in the Book (Quran). (Holy \nQuran, 6: 38) \nAllah says that one part of the Holy Quran verifies another part \nand that there is no divergence in it as He says the following: \nAnd if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely \nhave found in it much discrepancy. (Holy Quran, 4: 82) \n \nCertainly, the outside of the Holy Quran is wonderful and its \ninside is deep (in meaning). Its wonders will never disappear, its amazing \nthings will never pass away and its intricacies cannot be cleared except \nthrough itself. \n \nIt is a disputed problem that where there is no clear argument \nabout a matter in the religious law, whether there does in reality exist an \norder about it or not. The view adopted by Abul-Hassan al-Ash`ari and \nhis master Abu Ali al-Jubba’i is that in such a case Allah has not ordained \nany particular course of action but He assigned the task of finding it out \nand passing a verdict to the jurists so that whatever they hold as \nprohibited would be deemed prohibited and whatever they regard \npermissible would be deemed permissible. And if one has one view and \nthe other another, then as many verdicts will exist as there are views and \neach of them would represent the final order. For example, if one scholar \nholds that barley malt is prohibited and another jurist’s view is that it is \npermissible, then it would really be both prohibited and permissible. That \nis, for one who holds is prohibited, its use would be prohibited while for \nthe other its use would be permissible. About this (theory of) correctness, \nMuhammad ibn Abdul-Karim al-Shahristani writes the following: \n \nA group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad (research) \nis applied there is no settled view about permissibility or; otherwise, and \nand lawfulness and prohibition thereof, but whatever the mujtahid (the \nresearcher scholar) hold is the order of Allah because the ascertainment of \nthe view of Allah depends upon the verdict of the mujtahid. If it is not so, \nthere will be no verdict at all. And according to this view, every mujtahid \nwould be correct in his opinion. Refer to p. 98 of Al-Milal wal Nihal. \n \nIn this case, the mujtahid is taken to be above mistake because a \nmistake can be deemed to occur where a step is taken against reality, but \nwhere there is not reality of verdict, mistake has no sense. Besides this, \nthe mujtahid can be considered to be above mistake if it is held that Allah, \nbeing aware of all the views that were likely to be adopted has ordained as \nmany final orders as a result of which every view corresponds to some \nsuch order, or that Allah has assured that the views adopted by the \nmujtahids should not go beyond what He has ordained, or that by chance, \nthe view of everyone of them would, after all, correspond to some \nordained order or other. \n \nThe Imamiyyah sect, however, has a different theory, namely that \nAllah has neither assigned to anyone the right to legislate nor subjected \nany matter to the view of the mujtahid, nor in case of a difference of \nviews has He ordained numerous real orders. Of course, if the mujtahid \ncannot arrive at a real order than whatever view he takes after research \nand probing is enough for him and his followers to act by. Such an order \nis the apparent order which is a substitute for the real order. In this case, \nhe is excused for missing the real order because he did his best for diving \nin the deep ocean and to explore its bottom. But, it is a pity that instead of \npearls he go only the seashell. He dos not say that observers should except \nit as a pearl or it should see as such. It is a different matter that Allah, who \nwatches the endeavors, may price it at half so that the endeavor does not \ngo to waste nor his passion discouraged. \n \nIf the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict on law \nand every opinion shall have to be accepted as correct as Maybudhi has \nwritten in fatwa: “In this matter, the view adopted by al-Ash`ari is right. It \nfollows that differing opinions should all be right. Beware, do not bear a \nbad idea about jurists and do not open your tongue to abuse them. \n \nWhen contrary theories and divergent views are accepted as \ncorrect, it is strange why the action of some conspicuous individuals are \nexplained as mistakes of decision since mistakes of decision by the \nmujtahid cannot be imagined at all. If the theory of correctness is right, \nthe action of Mu`awiyah and `}’isha should be deemed right; but if their \nactions can be deemed to be wrong then we should agree that ijtihad can \nalso go wrong and that the theory of correctness is wrong. It will then \nremain to be decided in its own context whether feminism did not impede \nthe decision of Aisha or whether it was a (wrong) finding of Mu`awiyah \nor something else. However, this theory of correctness was propounded in \norder to cover mistakes and to give them the garb of Allah’s orders so that \nthere should be no impediment in achieving objectives nor should anyone \nbe able to speak against any misdeeds. \n \nIn this sermon, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has referred to those people \nwho deviate from the path of Allah and closing their eyes to light, grope \nin the darkness of imagination, make faith the victim of their views and \nopinions, pronounce new findings, pass orders by their own imagination \nand produce divergent results. Then on the basis of the theory of \ncorrectness, they regard all these divergent and contrary orders as from \nAllah as though each of their orders represent the Divine revelation so \nthat no order of theirs can be wrong nor can they stumble on any \noccasion. Thus, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) says in disproving this view that: \n \n1) When Allah is One, the Book (Holy Quran) is one and the \nProphet (h) is one, then the religion (that is followed) should also be one. \nAnd when the religion is one, how can there be divergent orders about \nany matter because there can be divergence in an order only in case he \nwho passed the order has forgotten it or is oblivious or senselessness \novertakes him or he willfully desires entanglement in these labyrinths \nwhile Allah and the Prophet (h) are above these things. These \ndivergences cannot, therefore, be attributed to them. These divergences \nare rather the outcome of the thinking and opinions of people who are \nbent on twisting the delineations of religion by their own imaginative \nperformances.\n \n2) Allah must have either forbidden these divergences or ordered \ncreating them. If He has ordered in their favor, where is that order and at \nwhat place? As for forbidding, the Holy Quran says the following: \nSay: Has Allah permitted you, or do you forge a lie against \nAllah?! (Holy Quran 10: 59) \n \nThat is, everything that is not in accordance with the Divine \norders is a concoction and concoction is forbidden and prohibited. For \nthose who concoct things, there is in the next world neither success, nor \nachievement, nor prosperity and good. Thus Allah says the following: \nAnd utter you not whatever lie describes your tongues (saying): \nThis is lawful and this is forbidden, to forge a lie against Allah; verily, \nthose who forge a lie against Allah do not succeed. (Holy Quran, 16: \n116)\n \nIf Allah has left religion incomplete and the reason for leaving it \nhalfway was that He desired that the people should assist Him in \ncompletely the religious code and share with Him in the task of \nlegislating, then this belief is obviously polytheism. If He sent down the \nreligion in complete form, the Prophet (h) must have failed in conveying \nit so that room was left for others to apply imagination and opinion. This, \nAllah forbid, would mean a weakness of the Prophet (h) and a bad slur \nof the selection of Allah. \n \n4) Allah has said in the Holy Quran that He has not left out \nanything in the Book and has clarified each and every matter. Now, if an \norder is carved out in conflict with the Holy Quran it would be outside the \nreligious code and its basis would not be on knowledge and perception, or \nthe Holy Quran and Sunnah, but it would be a personal opinion and one’s \npersonal judgment which cannot be deemed to have accord with religion \nand faith. \n \n5) Holy Quran is the basis and source of religion and the fountain \nhead of the laws of Shari’a. If the laws of Shari’a were divergent, there \nshould have been divergence in it also. And, if there were divergences in \nit, it could not be regarded as the Divine word. When it is the Divine word \nthe laws of Shari`a cannot be divergent so as to accept all divergent and \ncontrary views as correct and imaginative verdicts taken as Quranic \ndictates."

    "text": "Amir al-Mu’minin (x) delivering a lecture from the pulpit of \n(the mosque of) Kufa when al-Ash`ath ibn Qays1 objected and said, \n“O Amir al-Mu’minin (x)! This thing is not in your favor but against \nyou.2 Amir al-Mu’minin (x) looked at him with anger and said: \n \n127Who is this al-Ash`ath ibn Qays al-Kindi, anyway? His original name \nwas Ma`di Karb and surname Abu Muhammad but, because of his disheveled hair, \nhe is better known as Al-Ash`ath, one having disheveled hair. After the \nproclamation of Prophethood, he came to Mecca along with his tribe. The Prophet \n(h) invited him and his tribe to accept Islam. When, after the Hijra (migration of \nthe Holy Prophet [h] from Mecca to Medina), Islam became established and in full \nswing. Deputations began to come to Medina in large numbers. He, too, came to the \nProphet’s audience with Banu Kindah and accepted Islam. The author of Al-Isti`ab\nwrites that after the Prophet (h), this man again turned unbeliever but when the \nCaliphate of Abu Bakr, he was brought to Medina as a prisoner, he again accepted \nIslam, though this time too, his Islam was a show. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad `Abdo \nwrites in his annotations on Nahjul-Balagha:\n \nJust as Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Sallul was a companion of the Prophet \n(h), al-Ash`ath was a companion of Ali and both were high-ranking hypocrites. He \nHow do you know what is for me and what is against me? Curse \nof Allah and other be on you. You are a weaver and son of a weaver. You \nare the son of an unbeliever and yourself a hypocrite. You were arrested \nonce by the unbelievers and once by the Muslims, but you wealth and \nbirth could not save you from either. The man who contrives for his own \npeople to be put to sword and invites death and destruction for them does \ndeserve that the near ones should hate him and the remote ones should not \ntrust him. \n \nAs-Sayyid ar-Radi says the following: “This man was arrested \nonce when an unbeliever and once in the days of Islam.” As for Amir al-\nMu’minin’s words that the man contrived for his own people to be put to \nthe sword, the reference herein is to the incident which occurred to al-\n \nlost one of his eyes in the battle of Yarmuk. Ibn Qutaybah has included him in the \nlist of renown one-eyed personalities. Abu Bakr’s sister, Umm Farwah daughter of \nIbn Abu Quhafah, who was once the wife of an al-Azdi then of Tamim ad-Darmi, \nwas on the third occasion married to this al-Ash`ath. Three sons were born of her: \nMuhammad, Isma’il and Ishaq. Biography books indicate that she was blind. Ibn \nAbul-Hadid has quoted the following statement of Abul-Faraj wherefrom it appears \nthat this man was equally involved in the assassination of Ali (x):\n \nOn the night of the assassination [of Imam Ali (x)], Ibn Muljim came to \nal-Ash`ath ibn Qays and both retired to a corner of the mosque and sat there when \nHijr ibn Adiy passed by that side and he heard al-Ash`ath saying to Ibn Muljim, \nABe quick now or else dawn’s light will disgrace you. On hearing this, Hijr said to \nal-Ash`ath, “O one-eyed man! You are getting ready to kill Ali (x) and hastened \ntoward Ali ibn Abu Talib. But Ibn Muljim had preceded him and struck Ali with a \nsword. When Hijr turned back, people were crying. Ali (x) had been killed. \n \nIt was his daughter who killed Imam Hassan (x) with poison. Al-Mas`udi \nhas written the following: \n \nHis (Hassan’s) wife Ja`dah daughter of al-Ash`ath poisoned him while \nMu`awiyah had conspired with her that if she could contrive to poison Hassan (x), \nhe would pay her one hundred thousand dirhams and marry her to [his son] Yazid. \n(Refer to Muruj al-Dhahab, Vol. 2, p. 650) \n \nHis son, Muhammad ibn al-Ash`ath, was active in playing fraud with \nMuslim bin Aqil in Kufa and in shedding Imam Hussain’s blood in Kerbala’. \nDespite all these shameful stigmas, he is among those men from whom al-Bukhari, \nMuslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisa’i and Ibn Majah have related \ntraditions...! \nAsh`ath ibn Qays in confrontation with Khalid ibn al-Walid at Yamama, \nwhere he deceived his people and contrived a trick until Khalid attacked \nthem. After this incident his people nicknamed him, “`Urfan-Nar,” which \nin the parlance stood for “traitor”. \n \nAfter the battle of Nahrawan, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) was \ndelivering a sermon in the mosque of Kufa about the ill effects of \nArbitration when a man stood up and said, “O Amir al-Mu’minin (x)! \nFirst you discouraged us from this arbitration but thereafter you allowed \nit. We cannot understand which of these two was more correct and proper. \nOn hearing this, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) clapped his one hand over the \nother [as a sign of sorrow and grief as well as helplessness] and said, \n“This is the reward of one who gives up a firm view that is, this is the \noutcome of your own actions as you had abandoned firmness and caution \nand insisted on “arbitration”, but al-Ash`ath mistook it to mean as though \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) implied that Amy worry was due to having \naccepted arbitration, so he spoke out thus: “O Amir al-Mu’minin (x)! This \nbrings blame on your own self, whereupon Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said the \nfollowing with firmness: “What do you know what I am saying, “nd what \ndo you understand what is for me or against me?! You are a weaver and \nthe son of a weaver brought up by unbelievers, and a hypocrite are you. \nThe curse of Allah and that of all the world be upon you.” \n \nCommentators have written several reasons for Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) calling al-Ash`ath a weaver and a hypocrite. The first \nreason is because he and his father, like most of the people of his native \nland, pursued weaving cloth. So, in order to refer to the lowliness of his \noccupation, he has been called a “weaver”. The people of Yemen had \nother occupations also but mostly this profession was followed among \nthem. Describing their occupations, Khalid ibn Safwan has mentioned this \none first of all. \n \nWhat can I say about a people among whom are only weavers, \nleather dyers, monkey keepers and donkey riders? The hoopoe found \nthem out, the mouse flooded them128 and a woman ruled over them (Al-\nBayan wal-Tabyin, Vol. 1, p. 130). \n \n128This is a reference to the collapse of the famous Ma’rab Dam which \nwas once considered one of the engineering marvels of ancient times. Its \ncollapse, which is believed to have taken place between B.C. 650 - 115, caused \nthe Arabs to migrate from Yemen and populate other parts of the Arabian \npeninsula. __ Ed. \nThe second reason is that hiyaka means walking by bending on \neither side and since out of pride and conceit this man used to walk \nshrugging his shoulders and making bends in this body, he has been \ncalled hayik. \n \nThe third reason is this: It is more conspicuous and clear that he \nhas been called a weaver to denote his foolishness and lowliness because \nevery low person is proverbially known as a “weaver”. Their wisdom and \nsagacity can be well-gauged by the fact that their follies had become \nproverbial while nothing attains proverbial status without peculiar \ncharacteristics. Now that Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has also confirmed it, no \nfurther argument or reasoning is needed. \n \nThe fourth reason is that by this it is meant the person who \nconspired against Allah and the Holy Prophet (h) and prepared webs of \nwhich is the peculiarity of hypocrites. Thus, in Wasa’il ash- Shi`a (Vol. \n12, p. 101) it is stated that: “It was mentioned before Imam Ja`far as-\nSadiq (x) that the weaver is accursed when he explained that the weaver \nimplies the person who concocts against Allah and the Prophet (h).”\n \nAfter the word “weaver,” Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has used the \nword hypocrite and there is no conjunction in between them in order to \nemphasize the nearness of meaning thereof. Then, on the basis of this \nhypocrisy and concealment of truth, he declared him deserving of the \ncurse of Allah and all others, as Allah, the most Glorified One, says the \nfollowing:\nVerily, those that conceal what we have sent of (Our) manifest \nevidences and guidance, after what we have (so) clearly shown for \nmankind in the Book (they are), those that Allah does curse them and \n(also) curse them all those who curse (such ones) (Holy Quran, 2: 159). \n \nAfter this, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said, “You could not avoid the \ndegradation of being prisoner when you were unbeliever, not did these \nignominies spare you after acceptance of Islam and you were taken \nprisoner. When an unbeliever, the event of his being taken prisoner \noccurred in this way that when the tribe of Banu Murad killed his father \nQays, he (al-Ash`ath) gathered the warriors of Banu Kindah and divided \nthem into three groups. He himself took the command over one group. On \nthe others, he placed Ka`b ibn Hani’ and al-Qash`am ibn Yazid al-Arqam \nas commanders. They set off to deal with Banu Murad. But as misfortune \nwould have it, instead of Banu Murad, they attacked Banu al-Harith ibn \nKa`b. The result was that Ka`b ibn Hani’ and al-Qash’am ibn Yazid al-\nArqam were killed and this man was taken prisoner. Eventually, he got \nreleased by paying three thousand camels as his ransom. In Amir al-\nMu’minin’s words, “Your wealth or birth could not save you from either \nis a reference not to the real ransom money because he was actually \nreleased on payment of the release money, but the intention is that neither \nplenty of wealth nor high status and prestige in the tribe could save him \nfrom this ignominy, and he could not protect himself from being taken \ncaptive.\n \nThe event of his second imprisonment is that when the Holy \nProphet of Islam (h) passed away from this world, a rebellion took place \nin the area of Hadramawt for repelling which Caliph Abu Bakr wrote to \nits governor, Ziyad ibn Labid al-Bayadi al-Ansari, to secure allegiance \nand collect zakat and charities from those people. When Ziyad ibn Labid \nwent to the tribe of Banu Amr ibn Mu`awiyah for collecting the zakat, he \ntook a keen fancy for a she-camel of Shaytan ibn Hijr which was very \nhandsome and had a huge body. He jumped over it and took possession of \nit. Shaytan ibn Hijr did not agree to spare it and suggested to him to take \nsome other she-camel in its place, but Ziyad did not agree. Shaytan sent \nfor his brother al-Adda’ ibn Hijr for his support. On coming he too had a \ntalk but Ziyad insisted on this point and did not, by any means, consent to \nkeep off his hand from that she-camel. At last, both these brothers \nappealed to Masruq ibn Ma’di Karib for help. Consequently, Masruq also \nused his influence so that Ziyad might leave the she-camel but he refused \ncategorically, whereupon Masruq became enthusiastic and untying the \nshe-camel handed it over to Satan. On this, Ziyad was infuriated and \ncollecting his men became ready to fight. On the other side, Banu Wali’ah \nalso assembled to face the but could not defeat Ziyad and were badly \nbeaten at his hands. Their women were taken away and property was \nlooted. Eventually those who had survived were obliged to take refuge \nunder the protection of al-Ash`ath. Al-Ash`ath promised assistance on the \ncondition that he should be acknowledged ruler of the area. Those people \nagreed to this condition and his coronation was also formally solemnized. \nAfter having his authority acknowledged he arranged an army and set out \nto fight Ziyad. On the other side Abu Bakr had written to the chief of \nYemen, al-Muhajir ibn Abu Umayyah to go for the help of Ziyad with a \ncontingent. Al-Muhajir was coming with his contingent when they came \nface-to-face. Seeing each other, they drew swords and commenced \nfighting at az-Zurqan. In the end al-Ash`ath fled from the battle-field and \ntaking his remaining men closed himself in the fort of an-Najjar. The \nenemy was such as to let them alone. They laid siege around the fort. Al-\nAsh`ath thought how long could he remain shut up I the fort with the lack \nof equipment and men and that he should think out some way of escape. \nSo one night he stealthily came out of the fort and met Ziyad and al-\nMuhajir and conspired with them that if they gave asylum to nine \nmembers of his family, he would get the fort gate opened. They accepted \nthis term and asked him to write for them, the names of those nine \npersons. He wrote down the nine names, but acting on his traditional \nwisdom forgot to write his own name in that list. After settling this, he \ntold his people that he had secured protection for them and the gate of the \nfort should be opened. When the gate was opened Ziy\\sect fs22 ad As \nforces pounced upon them. They said they had been promised protection \nwhereupon Ziyad’s army said that this was wrong and that al-Ash`ath had \nasked protection only for nine members of his house, whose names were \npreserved with them. In short, eight hundred persons were put to sword \nand the hands of several women were hopped off, while according to the \nsettlement, nine men were left, but the case of al-Ash`ath became \ncomplicated. Eventually, it was decided that he should be sent to Abu \nBakr and he should decide about him. At last, he was sent to Medina in \nchains along with a thousand women prisoners. On the way, relations and \nothers, men and women, all hurled curses at him and the women were \ncalling him traitor and the one who got his own people put to sword. Who \nelse can be a great traitor? However, when he reached Meduna, Abu Bakr \nreleased him and on that occasion, he was married to Umm Farwah."

Satan has certainly started instigating his forces and has \ncollected his army in order that oppression may reach its extreme ends \nand wrong may come back to its status. By Allah, they have not put a \ncorrect blame on me, nor have they done justice between me and \nthemselves. \n \nThey are demanding of me a right which they have abandoned \nand a blood that they have themselves shed. If I were a partner with them \nin it then they too have their share of it. But if they did it without me they \nalone have to face the consequences. Their biggest argument (against me) \nis really against their own selves. They are suckling from a mother who is \nalready dry and bringing into life innovation that is already dead. How \ndisappointing is this challenger 9to battle) ? Who is this challenger and \nfor what is he being responded to? I am happy that the reasoning of Allah \nhas been exhausted before them and He knows (all) about them. If they \nrefuse (to obey) I will offer them the edge of the sword which is enough \nof a cure of wrong and supporter of right. \n \nIt is strange that they send me word to proceed to them for spear-\nfighting and to keep ready for fighting with swords. May the mourning \nwomen mourn over them. I have ever been so that I as never frightened \nby fighting nor threatened by clashing. I enjoy full certainty of belief from \nmy Allah and have no doubt in my faith. \n \nWhen Amir al-Mu’minin (x) was accused of `Othman’s \nassassination, he delivered this sermon to refute that allegation, wherein \nhe says about those who blamed him that: “These seekers of vengeance \ncannot say that I alone am the assassin and that no one else took part in it. \nNor can they falsify witnessed events by saying that they were \nunconcerned with it. Why then have they put me foremost for this \navenging? With me they should include themselves also. If I am free of \nthis blame they cannot establish their freedom from it. How can they \ndetach themselves from this punishment? the truth of the matter is that by \naccusing me of this charge, their aim is that I should behave with them in \nthe same manner to which they are accustomed. But they should behave \nwith them in the same manner to which they are accustomed. But they \nshould not expect from me that I would revive the innovations of the \nprevious regimes. As for fighting, neither was I ever afraid of it nor am I \nso now. Allah knows my intention and He also knows that those standing \non the excuse of taking revenge are themselves his assassins. Thus, \nhistory corroborates that the people who managed his (Othman’s) \nassassination by agitation and had even prevented his burial in Muslims’ \ngraveyard by hurling stones at his coffin were the same who rose for \navenging his blood. In this connection, the names of Talhah ibn \nUbaydillah, az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Aisha are at the top of the list \nsince on both occasions their efforts come to sigh with conspicuity. Thus \nibn Abul-Hadid writes that: “Those who have written the account f the \nassassination of Othman state that one ht day of his killing Talhah’s \ncondition was that in order to obscure himself form the eyes of the people \nhe had a veil on his face and was shooting arrows at Othman’s house.” \n \nAnd, in this connection about az-Zubayr ideas he writes the \nfollowing: “Historians have also stated that az-Zubayr used to say: “Kill \nOthman. He has altered your faith.’129 People said, “Your son is standing \nat his door and guarding him and he replied, “Even my son my be lost, \nbut Othman must be killed. Othman will be lying like a carcass on the \nSirat tomorrow” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 9, pp. 35-36). \n \n129Az-Zubayr here was echoing what his cousin, Aisha, used to say, that is, \nUqtulu Na`thal faqad kafar (Kill Na`thal [a bad name whereby she called Othman], \nfor he has committed apostasy). __ Ed. \nAbout Aisha, Ibn Abd Rabbih writes the following: “Mughirah \nibn Shu’bah came to Aisha when she said, “O Abu Abdullah, I wish you \nhave been with me on the day of Jamal; how arrows were piercing \nthrough my hawdaj (camel litter) till some of them stuck my body.’ Al-\nMughirah said, “I wish one of them should have killed you.’ She said, \n“Allah may have pity on you; why so?’ He replied, “So that it would have \nbeen some atonement for what you had done against Othman’, according \nto Al-Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, p. 294."

The good \nmemory of a man that Allah retains among people is better than the \nproperty which others inherit from him. \nIn the same sermon, he says the following: \n \nBehold! If any one of you finds your near ones in want or \nstarvation, he should not desist from helping them with that which will \nnot increase if this help is not extended nor decrease by thus spending it. \nWhoever holds up his hand from (helping) his kinsmen, he holds only one \nhand, but at the same time of his need, many hands remain held up form \nhelping him.

In some versions for al-ghafira, the \nword afwatan appears. Afwa means the good and selected part of \nanything. It is said: akaltu afwata’t-ta`am, to mean ‘I ate a choice meal.’” \nAbout Awa man yaqbid yadahu an’ashiratihi appearing towards the end, \nhe points out how beautiful the meaning of this sentence is, Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) implies that he who does not help his own kinsmen \nwithholds only his hand but when he is in need of their assistance and \nwould be looking for their sympathy and support, then he would remain \ndeprived of the sympathies and succor of so many of their extending \nhands and marching feet."

Only a hundred men stuck to their status and they faced them \nas stoutly as they could. But, collecting together, the enemy’s force made \nsuch a severe attack that they too could no more resist and the chief of the \ncontingent, Hassan ibn Hassan al-Bakri was killed along with thirty \nothers. When the battlefield was clear the enemy ransacked al-Anbar with \ntotal freedom and left the city completely destroyed. \n \nWhen Amir al-Mu’minin (x) got the news of this attack, he \nascended the pulpit and exhorted the people for crushing the enemy and \ncalled them to jihad. Yet, from no quarter was there any voice or \nresponse. He alighted from the pulpit utterly disgusted and worried and in \nthe same condition set off for the enemy on foot. When people observed \nthis their sense of self-respect and shame was also awakened and they too \nfollowed him. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) stopped at an-Nukhayla. People then \nsurrounded him and insisted that he return as they had enough to face the \nenemy. When their insistence increased beyond reckoning, Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) consented to return and Sa’id ibn Qays al-Hamdani \nproceeded forward with a force of eight thousand. But Sufyan ibn Awf al-\nGhamidi had gone, so Sa’id came back without any encounter. When \nSa’id reached Kufa then - according to the version of Ibn Abu’ Hadid - \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) was so deeply grieved and indisposed during those \ndays to an extent of not wishing to enter the mosque. He instead sat in the \ncorridor of his residence (that connects the entrance of the mosque) and \nwrote this sermon for the people but gave it to his slave Sa`d to read for \nthem. But al-Mubarrad (Al-Kamil, Vol. 1, pp. 104-107) has related from \n`Ubaydullah ibn Hafs al-Taymi, Ibn Aisha, that Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\ndelivered this sermon on a high place in an-Nukhayla. Ibn Maytham has \nheld this as a preferable view."

Today is the day of preparation while tomorrow is the day of \nrace. The place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is Hell. \nIs there no one to offer repentance over his faults before his death? Or is \nthere no one to perform virtuous acts before the day of trial? \n \nBeware, surely you are in the days of hopes behind which stands \ndeath. Whoever acts during the days of his hope before the approach of \nhis death, his action would benefit him and his death would not harm him. \nBut he who fails to act during the period of hope before the approach of \ndeath, his action is a loss and his death will harm him. Beware and act \nduring a period of attraction just as you act during a period of dread. \nBeware, surely I have not seen one who covets Paradise asleep nor dreads \nHell to be asleep. Beware, he whom right does not benefit must suffer the \nharm of the wrong and he whom guidance does not keep firm will be led \naway by misguidance towards destruction. \n \nBeware, you have been ordered insistently to march and have \nbeen guided as how to provide for the journey. Surely the most \nfrightening thing which I am afraid of about you is to follow desires and \nto widen the hopes. Provide for yourself from this world what would save \nyou tomorrow (on the Day of Judgement). \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “If there could be an utterance \nwhich would drag the neck towards renunciation in this world and force \naction for the next world, it is this sermon. It is enough to cut one off from \nthe entanglements of hopes and to ignite the flames of preaching (for \nvirtue) and warning (against vice). His most wonderful words in this \nsermon are: `Today is the day of preparation, while tomorrow is the day \nof race.’ The place to proceed to is Paradise while the place of doom is \nHell.’ Besides the sublimity of these words, the greatness of their \nmeaning, the true similes and factual illustrations, there are wonderful \nsecrets and delicate implications the rein.” \n \nIt is his saying that his place to proceed to is Paradise while the \nplace of doom is Hell. Here he has used two different words to convey \ntwo different meanings. For Paradise he has used the expression “place to \nproceed to” but for Hell this word has not been used. One proceeds to a \nplace which he likes and desires and this can be true for Paradise only. \nHell does not have the attractiveness that it may be liked or proceeded to. \nWe seek Allah’s protection from it. Since for Hell it was not proper to say \nAto be proceeded to Amir al-Mu’minin (x) employed the word doom, \nimplying the last place of stay where one reaches even though it may \nmean grief and worry or happiness and pleasure. \n \nThis word is capable of conveying both senses. However, it \nshould be taken in the sense of al-masir or al-ma’al, that is, the last resort. \nQuranic verse is “Say: Enjoy you (your pleasures for a while), for your \nlast resort is into (hell) fire” (Quran, 14: 30). Here, to say sabqatakum, \nthat is, “the place for you to proceed to,” in place of the word \n“masirakum,” that is, your doom or last resort would not be proper in any \nway. Think and ponder over it and see how wondrous is its inner \nimplication and how far its depth goes with beauty. Amir al-Mu’minin’s \nutterance is generally on these lines. In some versions the word sabqah is \nshown as subqah, which is applied to a reward fixed for the winner in a \nrace. However, both meanings are close to each other because a reward is \nnot for an undesirable action but for a good and commendable \nperformance."

    "text": "Disclosing Real Facts about the Assassination of Othman Ibn \nAffan, Amir Al-Mu’minin (x) Said: \n \nIf I had ordered his assassination I should have been his killer, but \nif I had refrained others from killing him I would have been his helper. \n \n131After the battle of Nahrawan, Mu`awiyah sent ad-Dahhak ibn Qays al-\nFihri with a force of four thousand towards Kufa with the purpose that he should \ncreate disorder in the area, killing whomever he found and keeping them busy with \nbloodshed and destruction so that Amir al-Mu’minan (x) should find no rest or \npeace of mind. He set off for the achievement of this aim and shedding innocent \nblood and spreading destruction all around reached the way up to the place of ath-\nTha`labiyya. He attacked a caravan of pilgrims (to Mecca) and looted all their \nwealth and belongings. Then at al-Qutqutana, he killed the nephew of Abdullah ibn \nMas`ud, the Holy Prophet’s companion, namely Amr ibn Uways ibn Mas`ud \ntogether with his followers. In this manner he created havoc and bloodshed all \naround. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) came to know of this wreck and ruin he called \nhis men to battle in order to put a stop to this vandalism, but people seemed to \navoid war. Being disgusted with their lethargy and lack of enthusiasm he ascended \nthe pulpit and delivered this sermon. He roused the men to feel shame and not to try \nand avoid war but to rise for the protection of their country like brave men without \nemploying wrong and lame excuses. At last, Hijr ibn Adiy al-Kindi rose with a \nforce of four thousand for crushing the enemy and overtook them at Tadmur. Only \na small encounter has taken place between the parties when night came on and they \nfled with only nineteen killed on their side. In Amir al-Mu’minin’s army, two \npersons fell as martyrs. \nThe status was that he who helped him cannot now say that he is better \nthan the one who deserted him while he who deserted him cannot say that \nhe is better than the one who helped him. I am putting before you his \ncase. He appropriated (wealth) and did it badly. You protested against it \nand committed excess the rein. With Allah lies the real verdict between \nthe one who appropriates and that who protests. \n \nOthman is the first Umayyad Caliph of Islam who ascended the \nCaliphate on the 1st of Muharram, 24 A.H. at the age of seventy. After \nhaving wielded full control and authority over the affairs of the Muslims \nfor twelve years, he was killed at their hands on the 18th of Dhul-Hijja, 35 \nA.H. And was buried at Hashsh Kawkab. \n \nOne fact cannot be denied: Othman’s killing was the result of his \nown weaknesses and the black misdeeds of the officers he appointed; \notherwise, there is no reason that Muslims should have unanimously \nagreed on killing him while no one except a few of his own house stood \nup to support and defend him. Muslims would have certainly given \nconsideration to his age, seniority, prestige and distinction of \ncompanionship of the Prophet (h) but his ways and deeds had so marred \nthe atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathize and side with \nhim. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on the high-ranking \ncompanions of the Prophet (h) had roused a wave of grief and anger \namong the Arab tribes. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his \nhaughtiness and wrong doings with disdainful eyes. Thus, due to Abu \nDharr’s disgrace, dishonor and the externment of Banu Ghifar and their \nassociate tribes, due to Abdullah ibn Mas`ud’s merciless beating of Banu \nHudhayl and their associates, due to the breaking of the ribs of Ammar \nibn Yasir Banu Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah and due to the \nplot for the killing of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Banu Taym all had a \nstorm of rage in their hearts. The Muslims of other cities were also \nbrimful of complaints at the hands of his officers, who under the \nintoxication of wealth and the effects of luxury did whatever they wished \nand crushed whomever they wanted. They had no fear of punishment \nfrom the center nor apprehension of any enquiry. People were fluttering to \nget out of their talons of oppression but no one was ready to listen to their \ncries of pain and restlessness. Feelings of hatred were rising but no care \nwas taken to put them down. The companions of the Prophet (h) were \nalso sick of him as they saw that peace was destroyed, the administration \nwas topsy-turvy and Islam’s features were being metamorphosed. The \npoor and the starving were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah \nwere rolling in wealth. The Caliphate had become a handle for belly-\nfilling and a means of amassing wealth. Consequently, they too did not \nlag behind in preparing the ground for killing him. Rather, it was at their \nletters and messages that people from Kufa, Basra and Egypt had \ncollected in Medina. Observing this behavior of the people of Medina, \nOthman wrote Mu`awiyah saying, “So now, certainly the people of \nMedina have turned heretics, have turned faith against obedience and \nbroken the (oath of) allegiance. Send me the warriors of Syria on brisk \nand sturdy horses.” \n \nThe policy adopted by Mu`awiyah on receipt of this letter also \nthrows light on the condition of the companions. Al-Tabari, the renown \nhistorian, writes the following after this: “When the letter reached \nMu`awiyah he pondered over it and considered it bad to openly oppose \nthe companions of the Prophet (h) since he was aware of their \nunanimity.” \n \nIn view of these circumstances to regard the killing of Othman as \na consequence of timely enthusiasm and temporary feelings and to hurl it \nat some insurgents is to veil the fact, since all the factors of his opposition \nexisted within Medina itself, while those coming from without had \ncollected for seeking redress of their grievances at their call. Their aim \nwas only improvement of the status, not killing or bloodshed. If their \ncomplaints had been heard then an occasion for this bloodshed would not \nhave arisen. What happened was that when, having been disgusted with \nthe oppression and excesses of `Abdullah ibn Sa`d ibn Abu Sahr who was \nfoster brother of Othman, the people of Egypt proceeded towards Medina \nand camped in the valley of Dhakhushub near the city. They sent a man \nwith a letter to Othman and demanded that oppression should stop, the \nexisting ways should be changed and repentance should be offered for the \nfuture. But instead of giving a reply, Othman turned these men out of the \nhouse and did not consider their demands worthy of any attention. \n \nThe people entered the city to raise their voice against this pride \nand haughtiness and complained to the people of this behavior besides \nother excesses. On the other side many people from Kufa and Basra had \nalso arrived with their complaints. After joining with the se, together they \nproceeded forward with the additional backing of the people of Medina \nand confined Othman within his house, although there was no restriction \non his going and coming to the mosque. But in his sermon on the very \nfirst Friday he severely rebuked these people and even held them \naccursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw pebbles at him. As a \nresult, he lost control and fell from the pulpit. After a few days, his \ncoming and going to the mosque was also banned. \nWhen Othman saw matters deteriorating to this extent he \nimplored Amir al-Mu’minin (x) very submissively to find some way for \nhis rescue and to disperse the people in whatever way he could. Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) said, “On what terms can I ask them to leave when their \ndemands are justified? Othman said, “I authorize you in this matter. \nWhatever terms you would settle with them I would be bound by them. \nSo Amir al-Mu’minin (x) went and met the Egyptians and talked to them. \nThey consented to return on the condition that all the tyrannies should be \nwiped out and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr made governor by removing ibn \nAbu Sahr. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) came back and put their demand before \nOthman who accepted it without any hesitation and said that to get over \nthese excesses, time was required. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) pointed out that \nfor matters concerning Medina delay had no sense. However, for other \nplaces so much time could be allowed that the Caliph’s message could \nreach them. Othman insisted that three days were also needed for Medina. \nAfter discussion with the Egyptians, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) agreed to it \nalso and took all the responsibility thereof upon himself. Then they \ndispersed at his suggestion. Some of them went to Egypt with Muhammad \nibn Abu Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub and stayed \nthere until this whole matter ended. On the second day of this event, \nMarwan ibn al-Hakam said to Othman, AIt is good, these people have \ngone, but to stop people coming from other cities you should issue a \nstatement so that they should not come this way, but sit quiet at their \nplaces. That statement should be that some people collected in Medina \nafter hearing some irresponsible talk but when they came to know that \nwhatever they heard was wrong they were satisfied and have gone back. \nOthman did not want to speak such a clear lie but Marwan canvassed him, \nso he agreed. Speaking in the Holy Prophet’s Mosque, he said, “These \nEgyptians had received some reports about their caliph, and when \nsatisfied that they were all baseless and wrong, they went back to their \ncities.”\n \nNo sooner had he said this when there was a great deal of \nmourning at the mosque, and people began to shout to Othman: “Repent! \nFear Allah! What is this lie you are uttering?!” Othman was confused in \nthis commotion and had to offer repentance. Consequently, he turned to \nthe Ka`ba, moaned in the audience of Allah and returned home. \n \nProbably after this very event, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) advised \nOthman saying, “You should openly offer repentance about your past \nmisdeeds so that these uprisings should subside for good. Otherwise, if \ntomorrow people of some other places come, you will again cling to my \nneck to rid you of them.” Consequently, Othman delivered a speech at the \nProphet’s Mosque wherein he admitted his mistakes, offering repentance \nand swearing to remain careful in future. He told the people that when he \nstepped down from the pulpit that their representatives should meet him \nand he would remove their grievances and meet their demands. On this \npeople acclaimed this action of his and washed away their ill-feelings \nwith tears to a great extent. \n \nWhen Othman reached his house, Marwan sought permission to \nsay something, but Othman’s wife Na’ila daughter of Qarafisah \nintervened. Turning to Marwan, she said, “For Allah’s sake, you keep \nquiet. You will surely say only such a thing as will bring nothing but \ndeath to him.” Marwan felt offended and retorted, “You have no right to \ninterfere in these matters. You are the daughter of that very person who \ndid not know till his death how to perform his ablution.” Na’ila replied \nwith fury, “You are wrong and are laying a false blame. Before uttering \nanything about my father, you should have cast a glance on the features of \nyour own father. But had it not been for my consideration for that old \nman, I would have spoken things at which people would have shuddered \nyet would have confirmed every word.” When Othman saw how the \nconversation between his cousin and wife was getting prolonged and \nnasty, he stopped them and asked Marwan to tell him what he wished. \nMarwan said, “What is it with you saying at the mosque what you said, \nand what repentance have you offered?! In my view, sticking to the sin \nwas a thousand times better than such repentance because no matter how \ngreat the sins might have been, they may multiply there, and there is \nalways room for repentance still, but repentance by force is no repentance \nat all. You have said what you have, but now see the consequences of this \nopen announcement: The crowds of people are now at your door. Now go \nforward and fulfil their demands.” Othman then said, “Well, I have said \nwhat I have said. Now you must deal with these people. It is not in my \npower to deal with them.” Consequently, finding out his implied consent, \nMarwan came out and addressing the people spoke out thus: “Why have \nyou assembled here? Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, \nyou cannot easily snatch away power from our hands, take that idea out \nfrom your hearts that you would subdue us. We are not to be subdued by \nanyone. Take away your black faces from here. Allah may disgrace and \ndishonor you.” \n \nWhen people noticed this changed countenance and altered \npicture, they rose from there full of anger and rage and went straight to \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) and related to him the whole story. On hearing it, \nmir al-Mu’minin (x) was infuriated and immediately went to Othman and \nsaid to him, “Good Heavens! How badly you have behaved with the \nMuslims! You have forsaken faith for the sake of a faithless and \ncharacterless man and have lost all wit. At least you should have regard \nand consideration for your own promise. What is this that at Marwan’s \nbeckoning you have set off with your eyes folded? Remember this: He \nwill throw you in such a dark well from which you will never be able to \ncome out. You have become the like a beast of burden for Marwan, so he \ncan now ride on you as he pleases and put you on whatever wrong way he \nwishes. In the future, I shall never intervene in your affairs, nor shall I tell \npeople anything. Now you should manage your affairs on your own.” \n \nSaying all this, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) got back, and when Na’ila \ngot the chance, she said to Othman, “Did I not tell you to get rid of \nMarwan or else he would put such a stain on you that it would not be \nremoved despite all your efforts? Well, what is the good in following the \nwords of one who is without any respect among the people and is held \nlow before their eyes? Make Ali agree; otherwise, remember that \nrestoring the disturbed state of affairs is neither within your power nor in \nthat of Marwan.” Othman was impressed by this statement, so he sent a \nman after Amir al-Mu’minin (x), but the Imam (x) refused to meet with \nOthman. There was no siege around Othman, but shame deterred him. \nWith what face could he come out of the house? But there was no way \nwithout coming out. Consequently, he came out quietly in the gloom of \nnight and reaching Amir al-Mu’minin’s place, he moaned his helplessness \nand loneliness, offered excuses and also assured him of keeping promises \nbut Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said, “You make a promise in the Prophet’s \nMosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled in this way that \nwhen people go to you they are rebuked and even abuses are hurled at \nthem. When this is the state of your undertakings which the world has \nseen, then how and on what grounds can I trust any word of yours in the \nfuture. Do not have any expectation from me now. I am not prepared to \naccept any responsibility on your behalf. The tracks are open before you. \nAdopt whichever way you like and tread whatever track you choose.” \nAfter this talk, Othman came back and began blaming Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) in retort to the effect that all the disturbances were rising at his \ninstance and that he was not doing anything despite being able to do \neverything. \nOn this side, the result of repentance was as it was. Now let us see \nthe other side. When after crossing the border of Hijaz, Muhammad ibn \nAbu Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the red Sea people \ncaught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel run so fast as \nthough the enemy was chasing him. These people had some misgivings \nabout him and, therefore, called him and inquired as to who he was. He \nsaid he was the slave of Othman. They inquired as to where he was \nbound. He said Egypt. They inquired to whom he was going. He replied \nto the Governor of Egypt. People said that the Governor of Egypt was \nwith them. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go to ibn Abu \nSahr. People asked him if any letter was with him. He denied. They asked \nfor what purpose he was going. He said he did not know that. One of \nthese people thought that his clothe s should be searched. So the search \nwas made, but nothing was found on him. Kinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi \nsaid, “See his water-skin.” People said, “Leave him, how can there be a \nletter in the water?!” Kinanah said, “You do not know what cunning these \npeople play.” Consequently, the water-skin was opened and seen. There \nwas a lead pipe in it wherein was a letter. When it was opened and read, \nthe Caliph’s order in it was that: “When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and \nhis party reach you, then from among them kill so-and-so, arrest so-and-\nso, and put-so-and so in jail. But you must remain at your post.” On \nreading this, all were stunned and thus began to look at one another in \nastonishment. As a Persian axiom says, “Mind was just burst in \nastonishment as to what wonder it was!” \n \nThose proceeding forward were riding into the mouth of death, \nconsequently they returned to Medna taking the slave with them. \nReaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of the \nProphet (h). Whoever heard this incident remained stunned with \nastonishment and there was no one who was not abusing Othman. \nAfterwards a few companions went to Othman along with these people \nand asked whose seal was there on this letter. He replied that it was his \nown. They inquired whose writing it was. He said it was his secretary’s. \nThey inquired whose slave was that man. He replied that it was his. They \ninquired whose riding beast it was. He replied that it was that of the \nGovernment. They inquired who had sent it. He said he had no knowledge \nof it. People then said, “Good Heavens! Everything is yours, but you do \nnot know who had sent it. If you are so helpless, you must leave this \nCaliphate and get away from it so that such a man can come who can \nadminister the affairs of the Muslims.” He replied, “It is not possible that \nI should put off the outfit of Caliphate which Allah has put on me. Of \ncourse, I would offer repentance.” People said, “Why should you speak of \nrepentance which has already been flouted on the day when Marwan was \nrepresenting you on your door and whatever was wanting has been made \nup by this letter. Now we are not going to be duped into these bluffs. \nLeave the Caliphate, and if our brethren stand in our way we will hold \nthem up; but if they prepare for fighting we too will fight. Neither our \nhands are stiff nor our swords blunt. If you regard all Muslims equally, if \nyou uphold justice, hand over Marwan and enable us to inquire from him \non whose strength and support he wanted to play with the precious lives \nof Muslims by writing this letter.” But Othman rejected this demand, \nrefusing to hand over Marwan to them, whereupon people said that the \nletter had been written at his behest. \n \nHowever, improving conditions again deteriorated and they ought \nto have deteriorated because despite lapse of the required time everything \nwas just as it had been and not a jot of difference had occurred. \nConsequently, the people who had stayed behind in the valley of \nDhakhushub to watch the result of repentance again advanced like a flood \nand spread over the streets of Medina and closing the borders from every \nside, surrounded his house. \n \nDuring these days of siege a companion of the Prophet (h),\nNiyar ibn AIyad, desired to talk to Othman, went to his house and called \nhim. When he peeped out from the above he said, “O Othman, for Allah’s \nsake give up this Caliphate and save the Muslims from this bloodshed. \nWhile he was just conversing, one of Othman’s men aimed at him with an \narrow and killed him, whereupon people were infuriated and shouted that \nNiyar’s killer should be handed over to them. Othman said it was not \npossible that he would hand over his own support to them. This \nstubbornness worked like a fan on fire and in the height of fury people set \nfire to his door and began advancing. When Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Sa`id \nibn al-As and Mughirah ibn al-Akhnas together with their contingents \npounced upon the besiegers, killing and bloodshed started at his door. \nPeople wanted to enter the house but they were being pushed back. In the \nmeanwhile, Amr ibn Hazm al-Ansari whose house was adjacent to that of \nOthman opened his door and shouted for advancing from that side. Thus \nthrough this house the besiegers climbed on the roof of Othman’s house \nand descended down from the re, drawing their swords. Only a few \nscuffles had taken place when all except the people of Othman’s house, \nhis well-wishers and Banu Umayyah ran away in the streets of Medina \nand a few hid themselves in the house of Umm Habiba daughter of Abu \nSufyan, sister of Mu`awiyah. The rest were killed with Othman as the \nlatter kept defending himself to the last (Al-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 3, \nPart 1, pp. 50-58; Tabari, Vol. 1, pp. 2998-3025; Al-Kamil, Ibn al-Athir, \nVol. 3, pp. 167-180; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 2, pp. 144-161). \n \nAt his killing, several poets wrote eulogies. A couplet from the \nelegy by Abu Hurayra is presented: \n \nToday people have only one grief, but I have two: \n \nThe loss of my money bag and the killing of Othman. \n \nAfter observing these events, the status of Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nbecame clear, namely that he was neither supporting the group that was \ninstigating Othman’s killing nor could he be included among those who \nstood for his support and defense. Rather, when he saw that what was said \nwas not acted upon he kept aloof. \n \nWhen both parties are looked at among the people who had raised \ntheir hands from Othman’s support, Aisha is seen as one. And according \nto the popular versions (which are not right), the then living persons out \nof the ten pre-informed ones (who had been pre-informed in this world by \nthe Prophet (h) as being admitted into Paradise), out of those who took \npart in the consultative committee (formed for Othman’s selection for \ncaliphate) Ansar, original Muhajirun, people who took part in the battle of \nBadr and other conspicuous and dignified individuals, while on the side \n(of Othman) are seen only a few slaves of the Caliph and a few \nindividuals from Banu Umayyah. If people like Marwan and Sa’id ibn al-\nAs cannot be given precedence over the original Muhajirun, their actions, \ntoo, cannot be given precedence over the actions of the latter. Again, if \nijma’ (consensus of opinion) is not meant for particular occasions... only \nthen it would be difficult to question this overwhelming unanimity of the \ncompanions."

    "text": "About the Disparagement of the World and Categories of its \nPeople\n \nO people! We have been born in such a wrongful and thankless \nperiod wherein the virtuous is deemed vicious and the oppressor goes on \nadvancing in his excess. We do not make use of what we know and do not \ndiscover what we do not know. We do not fear calamity till it befalls. \n \nPeople are of four categories. Among them is one who is \nprevented from mischief only by his low status, lack of means and paucity \nof wealth. \n \nThen there is he who has drawn his sword, openly commits \nmischief, has collected his horsemen and foot-man and has devoted \nhimself to securing wealth, leading troops, rising on the pulpit and has \nallowed his faith to perish. How bad is the transaction that you allow, \n(enjoyment of) this world to be a price for yourself as an alternative for \nwhat there is with Allah for you. \n \nAnd among them is he who seeks (benefits of) this world through \nactions meant for the next world, but does not seek (good of) the next \nworld through actions of this world. He keeps his body calm (in dignity), \nraises small steps, holds up his clothe s, embellishes his body for \nappearance of trust-worthiness and uses the status of Allah’s connivance \nas a means of committing sins. \n \nThen there is one whose weakness and lack of means have held \nhim back from conquest of lands. This keeps down his status and he has \nnamed it contentment and he clothe s himself with the robe of \nrenunciation although he has never had any connection with these \nqualities.\nThen there remain a few people in whose case the remembrance \nof their return (to Allah on the Last Day) keeps their eyes bent and the \nfear of resurrection moves their tears. Some of them are scared away \n(from the world) and dispersed. Some are frightened and subdued; some \nare quiet as if muzzled; some are praying sincerely. Some are grief-\nstricken and pain-ridden whom fear has confined to namelessness and \ndisgrace has shrouded them, so they are in (The sea of) bitter water. Their \nmouths are closed and their hearts are bruised. They preached till they \nwere tired, they were oppressed till they were disgraced and they were \nkilled till they remained few in number. \n \nThe world in your eyes should be smaller than the bark of the \nacacia and the clippings of wool. Seek instruction from those who \npreceded you before those who follow you take instruction from you and \nkeep aloof from it realizing its evil because it cuts off even from those \nwho were more attached to it than you. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Some ignorant persons \nattributed this sermon to Mu`awiyah but it is the speech of Amir al-\nMu’minin (x). There should be no doubt about it. What comparison is \nthere between gold and clay or sweet and bitter water.” This has been \npointed out by the skillful guide and the expert critic `Amr ibn Bahr al-\nJahiz as he has mentioned this sermon in his book, Al-Bayan wal-Tbyin \n(Vol. 2, pp. 59-61). He has also mentioned who attributed it to \nMu`awiyah then states that it is most akin to be the speech of Ali and \nmost in accord with his way of categorizing people and information about \ntheir oppression, disgrace, apprehension and fear. (On the other hand) we \nnever found Mu`awiyah speaking on the lives of those who renounce this \nworld or worshippers."

Then Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) said to me, “What is the price of this shoe?” I said: \n“It has no value now.” He then said, “By Allah! It should have been \nmore dear to me than ruling over you except for the fact that I have \nestablished right and warded off wrong.” Then the Imam (x) came \nout and spoke thus: \nVerily, Allah sent Muhammad (h) when none among the Arabs \nread a book or claimed Prophethood. He guided the people till he took \nthem to their (correct) status and their salvation and their spears (ie. \nofficers) became straight and their conditions settled down. \n \nBy Allah, surely I was in their lead till it took shape with its \nwalls. I did not show weakness or cowardice. My existing march is also \nlike that. I shall certainly pierce the wrong till right comes out of its side. \n \nWhat (cause of conflict) is there between the tribesmen of \nQuraish and me? By Allah, I have fought them when they were \nunbelievers and I shall fight them when they have been misled. I shall be \nthe same for them today as I was for them yesterday. \n \nBy Allah, the tribesmen of Quraish only take revenge against us \nbecause Allah has given us (i.e. The Holy Prophet (h) and his progeny) \npreference over them. So, we have allowed them into our domain, \nwhereupon they have become as the former poet says the following: \n \nBy my life, you continued drinking fresh milk every morning, \n \nAnd (continued) eating fine stoned dates with butter; \n \nWe have given you the nobility which you did not possess before; \nAnd surrounded (protected) you with thoroughbred horses and \ntawny colored spears (strong spears). \n \nThe fact is that the poet’s aim here is to say that the condition of \nthe addressee’s life, from the moral and material point of view, had been \nworse in the past and that the poet and his tribe had given him the best \nmeans of leading their lives. But as the result of this improved condition \nthe addressee has completely lost himself and forgotten his past condition \nand thinks that he had led this kind of life before. \n \nNow, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) wants to convey the same idea here \nto the tribesmen of Quraish as Fatima (x) the holy daughter of the Holy \nProphet (h) said in her speech on Fadak: \n \n(O People!) You were on the brink of the pit of Hill Fire (Holy \nQuran, 3: 103). You were as worthless as themouthful of water. You were \nof a minority like the handful of greedy and a spark of the hasty. You \nwere as down-trodden as the dust under your feet. You drank dirty water. \nYou ate untanned skin. You were abased and condemned. But Allah has \nrescued you through my father Muhammad (h)."

    "text": "Amir al-Mu’minin (x) Delivered this Sermon after the \nArbitration\n \nAll praise is due to Allah even though time has brought (to us) \ncrushing calamity and great occurrence. And I testify that there is no god \nbut Allah the One, there is no partner for Him nor is there with Him any \ngod other than Himself and that Muhammad (h) is His slave and Prophet \n(h).\n \n133This sentence is employed for such severance after which there is no \noccasion or possibility of joining. The author of Al-Durra al-Najafiyya has quoted \nseveral views in its explanation: \n \ni. Ibn Durayd’s view is that it means that, AJust as when the head is \nsevered its joining again is impossible. In the same way as you will not join me \nafter once deserting me. \n \nii. Al-Mufaddal says ar-ra’s (head) was the name of a man and a village of \nSyria, Bayt ar-ra’s is named after him. This man left his home and went away \nsomewhere and never again returned to his village after which the proverb sprang \nup Ayou went as ar-ra’s had gone. \n \niii. One meaning of it is that “Just as if the joints of the bones of the head \nare opened, they cannot be restored, likewise, you will not rejoin me after cutting \nyourselves away from me.” \n \niv. It has also been said that this sentence is in the sense of separating \ncompletely. After copying this meaning from the Sharh of Shaikh Qutbud-Dn ar-\nRawandi, the commentator Ibn Abul-Hadd has written that this meaning is not \ncorrect because when the word ar-ra’s is used in this sense of whole it is not \npreceded by alif and lam.\n \nv. It is also taken to mean that “You will so run away from me as one \n(fleeing for life) to save his head. Besides this, one or two other meanings have also \nbeen stated but being remote they are disregarded.” \n \nFirst of all it was used by the philosopher of Arabia Aktham ibn Sayfi \nwhile teaching unity and concord to his children. He says the following: \n \n“O my children! Do not cut away (from each other) at the time of \ncalamities like the cutting of the head because after that you will never get \ntogether.” \nSo now, certainly the disobedience of a sympathetic counselor \nwho has knowledge as well as experience brings about disappointment \nand that results in repentance. I had given you my orders about this \narbitration and put before you my hidden view that if Qasir’s2 orders were \nfulfilled but you rejected it (my orders) like rough opponents and \ndisobedient insurgents till the counselor himself fell in doubt about his \ncounsel and the flint (of his wit) ceased to give flame. Consequently, my \nstatus and yours became as the poet of Hawazin says the following: \n \nI gave you my orders at Mun’arajil-Liwa’ but you did not see the \ngood of my counsel till the noon of next day (when it was too late). \n \nWhen the Syrians’ spirit was broken by the bloody swords of the \nIraqis and the incessant attacks of the night of al-Harir lowered their \nmorale and ended their aspirations, Amr ibn al-As suggested to \nMu`awiyah the trick that the Holy Quran should be raised on spears and \nshouts urged forth to treat it as the arbitrator. Its effect would be that some \npeople would try to stop the war and others would like to continue it. We \nwould thus divide them and be able to get the war postponed for another \noccasion. Consequently, copies of the Holy Quran were raised on spears. \nThe result was that some brainless persons raised hue and cry and created \ndivision and disturbance in the army and the efforts of simple Muslims \nturned slow after having been near victory. Without understanding \nanything they began to shout that they should prefer the verdict of the \nHoly Quran over war. \n \nWhen Amir al-Mu’minin (x) saw the Holy Quran being the \ninstrument of their activities, he said:\n \nO people! Do not fall in this trap of deceit and trickery. They are \nputting up this device only to escape the ignominy of defeat. I know the \ncharacter of each one of them. They are neither adherents of the Holy \nQuran nor have they any connection with the faith or religion. The very \npurpose of our fighting has been that they should follow the Holy Quran \nand act on its injunctions. For Allah’s sake do not fall in their deceitful \ndevice. Go ahead with determination and courage and stop only after \nvanquishing the dying foe. Nevertheless, the deceitful instrument of \nwrong had worked. \n \nPeople took to disobedience and rebellion. Mis`ar ibn Fadaki at-\nTamimi and Zayd ibn Hussain at-Ta’i, each with twenty thousand men, \ncame forward and said to Amir al-Mu’minin (x) “O Ali! If you do not \nrespond to the call of the Holy Quran, we will deal with you in the same \nmanner as we did with Othman. You end the battle at once and bow \nbefore the verdict of the Holy Quran [is issued against you].” Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) tried his best to make them understand the trick, but Satan \nwas standing before them pretending to wear the garb of the Holy Quran. \nHe did not allow them to do so and they compelled Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nthat he should send someone to call Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar from \nthe battlefield. Being obliged, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent Yazid ibn Hani \nto call Malik back. When Malik heard this order he was bewildered and \nsaid, “Please tell him this is not the occasion to leave the status. He may \nwait a bit then I will come to his audience with the tidings of victory. \nHani conveyed this message on return but people shouted that Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) must have sent word to him secretly to continue.” Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) said he never got any occasion to send any secret message \nto him. Whatever he said was said before them. People said he should be \nsent again and that if Malik delayed his return Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nshould forsake his life. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) again sent Yazid ibn Hani \nand sent word that rebellion had occurred, he should return in whatever \ncondition he was. So Hani went and told Malik “You hold victory dear or \nthe life of Amir al-Mu’minin (x). If his life is dear you should raise your \nhands from the battle and go to him. Leaving the chances of victory Malik \nstood up and came to the audience of Amir al-Mu’minin (x) with grief \nand disappointment.” The Aws raged there. He rebuked the people very \nmuch but matters had taken such a turn that they could not be corrected. \n \nIt was then settled that either party should nominate an arbitrator \nso that they should settle the Caliphate matter according to the Holy \nQuran. From Mu`awiyah’s side `Amr ibn al-`}s was decided upon and \nfrom Amir al-Mu’minin’s side people proposed the name of Abu Musa \nal-Ash`ari. Seeing this wrong selection Amir al-Mu’minin (x) said, \n“Since you have not accepted my order about arbitration at least now \nagree that do not make Abu Musa the arbitrator. He is not a man of trust. \nHere is Abdullah ibn Abbas and here is Malik al-Ashtar. Select one of \nthem. But they did not listen to him and stuck to his name (Abu Musa).” \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) said, “Alright, do whatever you want. The day is \nnot far when you will cut your own hands through your misdeeds.” \n \nAfter the nomination of arbitrators, when the deed of agreement \nwas being written, the name of Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was also written. \n`Amr ibn al-As said, “This should be rubbed off. If we regard Amir al-\nMu’minin (x), why should this battle have been fought?” At first, Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) refused to rub it off but when they did not in any way \nagree, he rubbed it off and said, “This incident is just similar to the one at \nal-Hudaybiya when the unbelievers stuck on the point that the words \nAProphet (h) of Allah’ with the name of the Prophet (h) should be \nremoved and the Prophet (h) did remove it.” On this, Amr ibn al-As got \nangry and said, “Do you treat us as unbelievers.” Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nasked, “On what day have you had anything to do with believers and \nwhen have you been their supporters?” However, after this settlement, the \npeople dispersed and after mutual consultation these two arbitrators \ndecided that by removing both Ali and Mu`awiyah from the Caliphate the \npeople should be accorded the power to choose whomever they desired. \nWhen time came to its announcement there was a meeting at Dawmatul-\nJandal, a place between Iraq and Syria then the two arbitrators also \nreached there to announce the judgement on the fate of the Muslims. \nActing cunningly `Amr ibn al-`}s said to Abu Musa, “I regard it ill \nmanner to precede you. You are older in years and age; so, first you make \nthe announcement yourself.” Abu Musa succumbed to his flattery and \ncame out proudly. Standing before the gathering, he addressed them thus: \n“O Muslims! We have jointly settled that Ali ibn Abu Talib and \nMu`awiyah should be removed and the right to choose a Caliph be \naccorded to the Muslims. They should choose whomever they like.” \nSaying this he sat down. Now the turn was for `Amr ibn al-`}s and he \nsaid, “O Muslims! You have heard that Abu Musa has removed `Amr ibn \nAbu Talib; I also agree with it. As for Mu`awiyah, there is no question of \nremoving him. Therefore, I place him in his status.” No sooner than he \nsaid this there were cries all around. Abu Musa cried hoarse that it was a \ntrick, a deceit and said to `Amr ibn al-As, “You have played a trick and \nyour example is that of a dog on which if you load something he would \ngasp, or leave him, he would gasp.” Amr ibn al-As said, “Your example is \nlike the ass on whom books are loaded.” However, `Amr ibn al-`}s trick \nwas effective and Mu`awiyah’s shaking feet were again stabilized. \n \nThe above is a short sketch of the Arbitration whose basis was \nlaid in the Holy Quran and Sunnah. But was it a verdict of the Holy Quran \nor the result of those deceitful contrivances which people of this world \nalways employ to retain their authority? Could these pages of history be \nmade a torch-guide for the future and the Holy Quran and Sunnah not be \nused as a means of securing authority or as an instrument of worldly \nbenefits?\nWhen Amir al-Mu’minin (x) got the news of this lamentable \nresult of arbitration, he climbed on the pulpit and delivered this sermon \nevery word of which savors his grief and sorrow and at the same time it \nthrows light on soundness of his thinking, correctness of his opinion and \nforesighted sagacity. \n \nA proverb is used in this sermon borrowed from an occasion \nwhere the advice of a counselor is rejected and afterwards it is repented. \nThe fact is that the ruler of Hira, namely Jazimah al-Abrash, killed the \nruler of Jazira, `Amr ibn Zarib. Thereafter, his daughter Zabba was made \nthe ruler of Jazira. Soon after accession to the throne, she thought out a \nplan to avenge her father’s blood. Then she sent a message to Jazmah that \nshe could not alone carry on the affairs of the state and that if he could \nbecome her patron by accepting her as his wife, she would be grateful. \nJazmah was more than puffed up at this marriage proposal and prepared \nhimself to set off for Jazira with a thousand horsemen. His slave, Qasir, \nadvised him repeatedly that this was just a sign of deceit and trickery, and \nthat he should not place himself in this danger, but his wit had been so \nblinded that he could not think over why Zabba should select the \nmurderer of her father as her life’s companion. He then set off and \nreached the border of Jazira. Although Zabba’s army was present for his \nreception. she neither gave any special reception nor offered him a warm \nwelcome. Seeing this state, Qasir was again suspicious; he advised \nJazmah to get back, but nearness to the goal had further fanned his \npassion. Jazimah paid no heed and, stepping further, entered the city. \nSoon after his arrival, he was killed there then. When Qasir saw this he \nsaid, “Had the advice of Qasir been followed... etc. Since then, this \nproverb gained currency.” \n \nThe poet of Hawazin referred to in this sermon is Durayd ibn as-\nSimmah. He wrote the above-cited couplet after the death of his brother \nAbdullah ibn as-Simmah. Its facts are that `Abdullah, along with his \nbrother, led an attack of two groups of Banu Jusham and Banu Nasr who \nwere both from Hawazin and drove away many camels. On return when \nthey intended to rest at Mun`arajil-Liwa, Durayd said it was not advisable \nto stay there lest the enemy attacks from behind, but Abdullah did not \nagree and stayed the re. The result was that as soon as dawn appeared the \nenemy attacked and killed `Abdullah on the spot. Durayd also received \nwounds but he slipped away alive and after this he wrote a few couplets \nout of which one couplet is this wherein he has referred to the destruction \nresulting from his advice having been rejected."

    "text": "Warning the People of Nahrawan of Their Fate \n \nI am warning you that you will be killed on the bend of this canal \nand on the levee of this low area while you will have no clear excuse \nbefore Allah nor any open authority with you. You have come out of your \nhouses then the Divine decree entangled you. I had advised you against \nthis arbitration but you rejected my advice like adversaries and opponents \ntill I turned my ideas in the direction of your wishes. You are a group \nwhose heads are devoid of wit and intelligence. May you have no father! \n(Allah’s woe be to you!) I have not put you in any calamity nor wished \nyou harm. \n \nThe cause of the battle of Nahrawan dated back to the time \nfollowing the arbitration when Amir al-Mu’minin (x) was returning to \nKufa. The people who were foremost in pleading acceptance of \narbitration began to say that appointment of anyone other than Allah as \narbitrator is heresy and that, Allah forbid, by accepting the arbitration \nAmir al-Mu’minin (x) had become a heretic. Consequently, by distorting \nthe meaning of “There is no authority save with Allah they made simple \nMuslims share their view and separated from Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nencamped at Hanira’ near Kafa.” When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) learned of \nthis plot, he sent Sa`sa`ah ibn Suhan al-Abdi and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-\nHarithi in the company of Ibn Abbas toward them and afterwards he went \nto the place of their stay and dispersed them after discussion. \n \nWhen these people reached Kufa they began to spread thenews \nthat Amir al-Mu’minin (x) had broken the agreement of arbitration and \nthat he was again ready to fight against the Syrians. When Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) learned this, he contradicted it whereupon these people \nstood up in rebellion and encamped twelve miles from Baghdad in the \nlowlands area of the canal called Nahrawan. \n \nOn the other side, after hearing the verdict of arbitration Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) prepared to fight the army of Syria. He wrote to the \nKharijites that the verdict passed by the two arbitrators in pursuance of \ntheir heart’s wishes instead of the Holy Quran and Sunnah was not \nacceptable to him and he, therefore, decided to fight with them and they \nshould support him in crushing the enemy. But the Kharijites gave him \nthis reply, “When you had agreed to arbitration in our view you had \nturned heretic. Now if you admit your heresy and offer repentance we will \nthink over this matter and decide what we should do.” Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) understood from their reply that their disobedience and misguidance \nhad become very serious. To entertain any kind of hope from them now \nwas futile. Consequently, ignoring them, he encamped in the valley of an-\nNukhaylah with a view to marching towards Syria. When the army had \nbeen arrayed he came to know that the men desired to deal with the \npeople of Nahrawan first and to move towards Syria afterwards. Amir al-\nMu’minin (x), however, said that they should be left as they were, that \nthey themselves should first move towards Syria while the people of \nNahrawan could be dealt with afterwards. People said that they were \nprepared to obey every order of his with all their might whether he moved \nthis way or that way. The army had not moved when news about the \nrebellion of Kharijites began to reach them. Then it was learned that they \nhad butchered the governor of Nahrawan,’Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-\nAratt and his slave maid with the child in her womb and had killed three \nwomen of Banu Tay and Umm Sinan al-Saydawi. Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\nsent al-Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi to investigate but he too was killed by \nthem. When their rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal \nwith them. Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan. On \nreaching there Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent them word that those who had \nkilled Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be \nhanded over to him for avenging blood. Those people replied that they \nhad killed these persons jointly and that they considered it lawful to shed \nthe blood of all the people on his side. Even at this Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\ndid not take the initiative for the battle, but sent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari \nwith a message of peace. So he spoke to them aloud, “Whoever comes \nunder this banner or separates from that party and goes to Kufa or al-\nMada’in would get amnesty and he would not be questioned.” As a result \nof this, Farwah ibn Nawfal al-Ashja`i said that he did not know why they \nwere at war with Amir al-Mu’minin (x). Saying this, he separated along \nwith five hundred men. Similarly, one group after another began to \nseparate and some of them joined Amir al-Mu’minin (x). Those who \nremained numbered four thousand and according to al-Tabari’s account \nthey numbered two thousand eight hundred. Yet, these people were not in \nany way prepared to listen to the voice of truth and were ready to kill or \nbe killed. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) had stopped his men from taking the \ninitiative but the Kharijites put arrows in their bows and broke and threw \naway the sheathe s of their swords. Even at this juncture Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) warned them of the dire consequences of war and this \nsermon is about that warning and admonition. But they were brimming \nwith enthusiasm so much that they leapt on Amir al-Mu’minin’s force all \nof a sudden. This onslaught was so severe that the footmen lost ground \nbut they soon fixed themselves so firmly that the attack of arrows and \nspears could not dislodge them from their status. They soon cleared away \nthe Kharijites that except for nine persons who fled to save their lives, not \na single person was left alive. From Amir al-Mu’minin’s army only eight \npersons fell as martyrs. The battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38 A.H."

What \nare you waiting for to rise in the cause of Allah? Does not faith join you \ntogether, or sense of shame rouse you? I stand among you shouting and I \nam calling you for help, but you do not listen to my word and do not obey \nmy orders, till circumstances show their bad consequences. No blood can \nbe avenged through you and no purpose can be achieved with you. I \ncalled you to help your brethren but (instead) you made noises like the \ncamel having pain in the stomach and became loose like the camel with a \nthin back. Then a wavering weak contingent came to me from among \nyou: “as if they are being led to death and they are only watching134 (Holy \nQuran, 8: 6). \n \n134Mu`awiyah sent a contingent of two thousand soldiers under an-Nu’m \nan ibn Bashir to assault Aynu’t-Tamr. This place was a defence base of Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) near Kufa in which Malik ibn Ka`b al-Arhabi was in charge. \nAlthough there were a thousand combatants under him, at that moment, only a \nhundred men were present. When Malik noticed the offensive force advancing, he \nwrote to Amir al-Mu’minin (x) for help. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) received the \nmessage he asked the people for his help but only three hundred men got ready. As \na result Amir al-Mu’minin (x) was much disgusted and delivered this sermon in \ntheir admonition. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) reached his house after delivering \nthe sermon, Adiy ibn Hatim at-Ta’i came and said, “O Amir a-Mu’minin a \nthousand men of Banu Tayyi’ are under me. If you say I shall send them off. Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) said, “It does not look good that people of only one tribe should \nmeet the enemy. You prepare your force in the Valley of an-Nukhayla. \nAccordingly, he went there and called people to jihad, where, besides Banu Tay, \none thousand other combatants also assembled. They were still preparing to set off \nwhen word reached from Malik ibn Ka`b that there was no need for help as he had \nrepulsed the enemy. \n \nThe reason for this was that Malik had hastily sent `Abdullah ibn Hawalah \nal-Azdi off to Qarazah ibn Ka`b al-Ansari and Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym al-Azdi, so that \nif there was delay in the arrival of support from Kufa he could get help from here in \ntime. Abdullah went to both, but got no help from Qarazah. However, Mikhnaf ibn \nSulaym had gotten fifty persons ready under Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mikhnaf and they \narrived near evening. Until that time, the two thousand men (of the enemy) had not \nbeen able to subdue the hundred men of Malik. When an-Nu’man saw these fifty \nmen he thought that their forces had started coming in so he fled from the \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Amir al-Mu’minin’s word \nAmutadha’ib means Amudtarib (i.e. moved or troubled), as they say \nAtadha’ abat ar-rih (i.e. The winds blow in troubled manner). Similarly \nthe wolf is called Adhi’b because of its troubled movement."

Amir Al-Mu’minin (x)\nSaid:\n \nMay Masqalah be condemned. He acted like the noble but fled \nlike a slave. Before his admirer could speak (about him) he silenced him \nand before his eulogist could testify to his good deeds he closed his \nmouth. If he had stayed behind we would have taken from him what he \ncould easily pay and waited for the balance till his money increased. \n \nFollowing the “arbitration”, the Kharijites rose in defiance. A \nKharijite man of Banu Najiyah named al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji began \ninstigating people and set off towards al-Mada’in with a group killing and \nmarauding. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent Ziyad ibn Khasafah with three \nhundred men to check him. When the two forces met at al-Mada’in they \nattacked each other with swords. Only one encounter or so had taken \nplace when the gloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be \nstopped. When morning appeared Ziyad’s men noticed that five dead \nbodies of the Kharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off \nthe battlefield. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basra along with his men. \nThere he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz. Ziyad did \nnot move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) of it. Amir al-Mu’minin (x) called back Ziyad and sent Ma`qil ibn \nQays ar-Riyahi with two thousand experienced combatants towards \nAhwaz and wrote to the governor of Basra `Abdullah ibn Abbas to send \ntwo thousand swordsmen of Basra for the help of Ma`qil. Consequently, \nthe contingent from Basra also joined them at Ahwaz and after proper \norganization, they got ready to attack the enemy. But al-Khirrit marched \non along with his men to the hills of Ramhurmuz. These people also \nfollowed him and overtook him near these hills. Both arrayed their forces \nand started attacking each other. The result of this encounter was that \nthree hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the battlefield while \nthe rest ran away. Ma`qil informed Amir al-Mu’minin (x) of his \nperformance and of the enemy’s defeat when Amir al-Mu’minin (x)\ndirected him to chase them and to disintegrate their power so that they \nshould not be able to raise heads again. On receipt of this order, Ma`qil \nmoved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian Gulf, where al-\nKhirrit had by persuasion secured the cooperation of the people and \nenlisting men from here and the re, had collected a considerable force. \nWhen Ma`qil reached the re, he raised the flag of peace and announced \nthat those who had collected from here and there should flee. They would \nnot be assaulted. The effect of this announcement was that save for al-\nKhirrit’s own community all others deserted him. He organized those \nvery men and commenced the battle but valorous combatants of Basra \nand Kufa displayed such excellent use of swords that in a short time one \nhundred and seventy men of the insurgents were killed while an-Nu’man \nibn Suhban ar-Rasibi encountered al-Khirrit (ibn Rashid an-Naji) and \neventually attacked and killed him. Soon after his fall the enemy lost \nground an d they fled from the battlefield. Thereafter, Ma`qil collected all \nthemen, women and children from their camps at one place. From among \nthem those who were Muslims were released after swearing allegiance. \nThose who had turned heretics were called upon to re-embrace their \nSubmission to the Will of Allah (Islam). Consequently all except one old \nChristian secured their release by accepting Islam but the old man was \nkilled. Then, Ma`qil took with him those Christians of Banu Najiyah who \nhad taken part in this rebellion together with their families. When Ma`qil \nreached Ardashir Khurrah (a city of Iran) these prisoners wailed and cried \nbefore its governor Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani and beseeched \nin all humility to do something for their release. Masqalah sent word to \nMa`qil through Dhuhl ibn al-Harith to sell these prisoners to him. Ma`qil \nagreed and sold those prisoners to him for five hundred thousand Dirhams \nand told him to dispatch the price immediately to Amir al-Mu’minin (x).\nHe said that he was sending the first installment at once and the remaining \ninstallments would also be sent soon. When Ma`qil met Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) he related the whole event before him. Amir al-Mu’minin \n(x) ratified this action and waited for the price for some time, but \nMasqalah observed such deep silence as if nothing was due from him. At \nlast Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent a messenger to him with word to either \nsend the price or to come himself. On Amir al-Mu’minin’s order he came \nto Kufa and on demand of the price paid two hundred thousand Dirhams. \nBut, to evade the balance he went to Mu`awiyah, who made him the \ngovernor of Tabaristan. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) came to know all \nthis he spoke these words (as in this sermon). Its sum total is that: Had he \nstayed, we would have been considerate to him in demanding the price \nand would have waited for an improvement of his financial condition. But \nhe fled like slaves after displaying a showy act. Talk about his high \nperseverance had just started when people began to discuss his baseless \nand lowliness."

Consequently, he stayed with \nBanu Tamim. This was the time when Abdullah ibn Abbas, the governor of Basra \nhad gone to Kufa for condolence about Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, leaving Ziyad \nibn Ubayd (Abih) as his substitute. When the atmosphere in Basra began to \ndeteriorate, Ziyad informed Amir al-Mu’minin (x) of all the facts. Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) tried to get Banu Tamim of Kufa ready but they kept complete \nsilence and gave no reply. When Amir al-Mu’minin (x) saw this weakness and \nshamelessness on their part he said, “During the days of the Prophet (h) we did not \nsee whether those killed at our hands were our kith and kin, but whoever collided \nwith Right, we were prepared to collide with him. If we too had acted carelessly or \nbeen guilty of inaction like you then neither religion could have taken root nor \ncould Islam prosper. The result of this shaking was that A’yan ibn Dabi’ah al-\nMujashi’i prepared himself but on reaching Basra he was killed by the swords of \nthe enemy. Thereafter, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) sent off Jariyah ibn Qudamah as-\nSa`di with fifty men of Banu Tamim. First he tried his best to canvass his own tribe \nbut instead of following the right path they stooped to abusing and fighting. Then \nJariyah called Ziyad and the tribe of Azd for his help. Soon upon their arrival \n(`Abdullah) ibn al-Hadrami also came out with his men. Swords were used from \nboth sides for some time but eventually ibn al-Hadrami fled with seventy persons \nand took refuge in the house of Sabil as-Sa`di. When Jariyah saw no other way he \nset the house on fire. When the flames arose, they came out in search of safety but \ncould not succeed in running away. Some of them were crushed to death under the \nwall while others were killed. \nSoon after me a man will be placed over you with a broad mouth \nand a big belly. He will swallow whatever he gets and crave what he does \nnot get. You should kill him but (I know) you will not. He will command \nyou to abuse me and to renounce me. As for abusing me, you will because \nthat would mean purification for me and salvation for you. As regarding \nrenunciation, you should not renounce me because I have been born on \nthe natural religion (Islam) and was foremost in (accepting) it as well as \nin Hijra (migrating from Mecca to Medina). \n \nAbout the person to whom Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has alluded in \nthis sermon some people hold that he is Ziyad ibn Abih; some hold that he \nis Mughirah ibn Shu`bah. But most of the commentators have held him to \nmean Mu`awiyah and that is correct because the qualities that Amir al-\nMu’minin (x) has described prove true on him alone. Thus, Ibn Abul-\nHadid has written about the gluttonous quality of Mu`awiyah that once \nthe Prophet (h) sent for him and he was informed that Mu`awiyah was \nbusy eating. Then the second and the third time a man was sent to call \nhim but he brought the same news. Thereupon, the Prophet (h) said, \n“May Allah never satisfy his belly. The effect of this curse was that when \nhe felt tired of eating he would say ATake the food away, for, by Allah I \nam not satiated but I am tired and disgusted. Similarly, his abusing Amir \nal-Mu’minin (x) and ordering his officers for it are accepted facts of \nhistory which cannot be denied. In this connection such words were used \non the pulpit that even Allah and the Prophet (h) were hit by them. Thus, \nUmm al-Mu’minin Umm Salamah wrote to Mu`awiyah, “Certainly you \npeople abuse Allah and the Prophet (h) as you hurl abuses on Ali and \nthose who love him, while I do testify that Allah and Prophet (h) did \nlove him.”139\n \nThanks to `Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz who put an end to it and \nintroduced the following verse in place of the way abusive of Imam Ali \n(x) in the sermons: \nVerily Allah enjoins justice and benevolence (to others) by \ngiving to the kindred and forbids lewdness, evil and rebellion; He exhorts \nyou that you may take heed (Holy Quran, 16: 90). \n \n139Al-Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 3, p. 131. \nIn this sermon, Amir al-Mu’minin (x) has ordered his killing on \nthe basis of the Prophet’s order that “When you (O Muslims) see \nMu`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him.”140"

Shall I be a witness to my becoming heretic after the \nacceptance of faith and fighting in the company of the Prophet (h)?! AIn \nthat case I shall be misguided and I shall not be on the right path. (Holy \nQuran, 6: 56). So you should return to your evil places and get back on \nthe traces of your heels. Beware! Certainly, after me, you will meet \noverwhelming disgrace, sharp swords and traditions that will be adopted \nby the oppressors as a norm towards you.141\n \n140Siffin, pp.243, 248; Sharh Nahjul-Balagha of Ibn Abul Hadid, Vol. 1, \np.348; Tarkh Baghdad, Vol. 12, p.181; Mizan al-I’tidal, Vol. 2, p. 128; Tahthib al-\nTahthib, Vol. 2, p. 428; Vol. 5, p. 110; Vol. 7, p.324. \n141History corroborates that after Amir al-Mu’minin (x), the Kharijites had \nto face all kinds of ignominy and disgrace and wherever they raised their heads to \ncreate trouble they were met with swords and spears. Thus Ziyad ibn Abih, \nUbaydullah ibn Ziyad, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, Mis’ab ibn az-Zubayr and al-Muhallab \nibn Abu Sufrah left no stone unturned in annihilating them from the surface of the \nglobe. In particular, al-Muhallab had chased them and routed them thoroughly for \nnineteen years, resting only after completing their destruction. \n \nTabari writes that when ten thousand Kharijites collected in Silla wa \nsillibra (the name of a mountain in Ahwaz) then al-Muhallab faced them so \nsteadfastly that he killed seven thousand Kharijites, while the remaining three \nthousand fled for their lives towards Kirman. But when the Governor of Iran \nnoticed their rebellious activities he surrounded them in Sabur and killed a good \nnumber of them. Those who remained fled to Isfahan and Kirman. From there they \nagain formed a contingent and advanced towards Kufa via Basra. Al-Harith ibn \nAbu Rabi`ah al-Makhzumi and Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mikhnaf al-Azdi stood up with \nsix thousand combatants to stop their advance and turned them out of Iraq’s \nboundaries. In this way successive encounters completely trampled their military \npower and turning them out of cities compelled them to roam about in the deserts. \nAfterwards also, when they rose in the form of groups they were crushed. (Tarikh,\nVol. 2, pp. 580-591; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 4, pp. 196-206). \nFollowing: \n \nA storm may overtake you while there may be none to awaken \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “In the words wala baqiyah \nminkum abirun used by Amir al-Mu’minin (x), the abir has been related \nwith ba and ra, and it has been taken from the Arab saying Rajulun abirun \nwhich means the man who prunes the date-palm trees improves them. In \none version, the word is athir and its meaning is “relater of news.’ In my \nview, this is more appropriate, as though Amir al-Mu’minin (x) intends to \nsay that there should remain none to carry news. \n \nIn another version of the same sermon, the word appears as Abiz \nwith Aza’ which means one who leaps. One who dies is also called Abiz."

Two of them fled to Oman, two to Sajistan, two to Kirman and two to Jazira \nwhile one escaped to Tall Mawzan (Mawzan Hill). Of Amir al-Mu’minin’s party \nonly eight men fell as martyrs. \nBy Allah!

So those who are themselves in the wrong have no right to fight others \nin the wrong. Again, those who are willfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight \nthose who are in the wrong by mistake. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words \nmake this fact clear that the misguidance of Kharijites was not willful but under \nSatan’s influence. They mistook wrong as right and stuck to it. On the other hand, \nthe status of misguidance of Mu`awiyah and his party was that they rejected right \nrealizing it as right and appropriated wrong as the code of their conduct knowing \nthat it was wrong. Their audacity in the matter of religion reached the stage that it \ncan neither be regarded as a result of misunderstanding nor can it be covered under \nthe garb of error of judgement. They openly transgressed the limits of religion and \npaid no heed to the Prophet’s injunctions in comparison with their own view. Thus, \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written (Vol. 5, p.130) that when the Prophet’s companion \nAbud-Darda’ saw utensils of gold and silver being used by Mu`awiyah he said he \nhad heard the Prophet (h) saying, “One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver \nwill feel flames of the fire of Hell in his stomach, whereupon Mu`awiyah said, As \nfor me, I do not find any harm in it. Similarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih’s blood \nrelationship with himself by his own opinion in total disregard of the Prophet’s \ninjunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet (h) over the pulpit, \ntransgressing the limits of shari’ah, shedding blood of innocent persons and placing \nover Muslims (as so-called caliph) a vicious individual and thus opening the way to \ndisbelief and atheism are events that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is \nlike willfully closing one’s eyes to historic fact and common sense. \ncalamities. Those who have taken worldly pleasures here will be taken out \nfrom them (by death) and will be questioned about them.

    "text": "When after the Death of the Prophet (h) News Reached \nImam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) about the Happening in Saqifa of Banu \nSa’i-dah, He Inquired What the Ansar Said. People Said That They \nWere Asking for One Chief from among Them and One from the \nOthers, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Said the Following: \n \nWhy did you not argue against them (Ansar) that the Prophet (h)\nhad left his will that whoever is good among the Ansar should be treated \nwell and whoever is bad should be forgiven. \n \nPeople said the following: “What is there against them in it?” \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “If the Government was for \nthem there should have been no will in their favor.” \n \nThen he said the following: “What did the tribesmen of Quraish \nplead?” People answered: “They argued that they belong to the lineal tree \nof the Prophet (h).”\n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “They argued with the tree but \nspoiled the fruits.” \n \nFrom what happened at the saqifa of Banu Sa’idah, it appears that \nthe greatest argument of the Muhajirun against the Ansar and the basis of \nthe former’s success was this very point that since they were the kith and \nkin of the Prophet (h) no one else could deserve the Caliphate. On this \nvery ground the big crowd of Ansar became ready to lay down their \nweapons before three Muhajirun and the latter succeeded in winning the \nCaliphate by presenting their distinction of descent. Thus in connection \nwith the events of saqifa al-Tabari writes that when the Ansar assembled \nin the saqifa (shed) of Banu Sa`idah to swear allegiance on the hand of \nSa`d ibn Abadah, somehow Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaydah ibn al-\nJarrah also got the hint and reached the re. Umar had thought out \nsomething for this occasion and he rose to speak but Abu Bakr stopped \nhim and he himself stood up. After praising Allah and the migration of the \nMuhajirun and their precedence in Islam, he said the following: “They are \nthose who worshipped Allah first of all and accepted belief in Allah and \nhis Prophet’s friends and his kith and kin. Therefore, these alone deserve \nthe Caliphate themost. Whoever clashes with them commits excess.” \n \nWhen Abu Bakr finished his speech, al-Hubab ibn Mundhir stood \nup and, turning to the Ansar said the following: “O group of Ansar! Do \nnot give your reins in the hand of others. The populace is under your care. \nYou are men of honor, wealth, tribe and gathering. If the Muhajirun have \nprecedence over you in some matters, you too have precedence over them \nin other matters. You gave them refuge in your houses. You are the \nfighting arm of Islam. With your help Islam stood on its own feet. In your \ncities the prayer of Allah was established with freedom. Save yourselves \nfrom division and dispersion and stick to your right unitedly. If the \nMuhajirun do not concede to your right tell them there should be one \nchief from us and one from them. \n \nNo sooner had al-Hubab sat down after saying this then Umar \nrose and spoke thus: “This cannot be! There can be no two rulers at one \nand the same time. By Allah! The Arabs will never agree to have you as \nthe head of the state since the Prophet (h) was not from among you. \nCertainly, the Arabs will not have the least objection in that the caliphate \nis allowed to one in whose house the Prophethood rests so that the ruler \nshould also be from the same house. For those who dissent, clear \narguments can be put forth. Whoever comes in conflict with us in the \nmatter of the authority and rulership of Muhammad (h) he is leaning \ntowards wrong, is a sinner and is falling into destruction. \n \nAfter `Umar, al-Hubab again stood up and said to the Ansar, \nALook, stick to your point and do not pay heed to the views of this man \nor his supporters. They want to trample your rights. If they do not consent \nturn him and them out of your cities and appropriate the Caliphate. Who \nother than you can deserve it more? \n \nWhen al-Hubab finished `Umar scolded him. There was a use of \nbad words from that side also and the status began to worsen. On seeing \nthis Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah spoke with the intention of cooling down \nthe Ansar and to win them over to his side and said the following: \n \n“O Ansar! You are the people who supported us and helped us in \nevery manner. Do not now change your ways and do not give up your \nbehavior.” But the Ansar refused to change their mind. They were \nprepared to swear allegiance to Sa`d and people just wanted to approach \nhim when a man of Sa`d’s tribe Bashr ibn `Amr al-Khazraji stood up and \nsaid the following: “No doubt we came forward for jihad and gave \nsupport to the religion, but our aim in doing thus was to please Allah and \nto obey His Prophet (h). It does not behoove us to claim superiority and \ncreate trouble in the matter of the caliphate. Muhammad (h) was from \nQuraish and they have a greater right for it and are more appropriate for \nit.”\n \nAs soon as Bashir uttered these words, dissension occurred \namong the Ansar, and this exactly was his aim because he could not see a \nman of his own tribe rising so high. The Muhajirun took advantage of this \ndivision among the Ansar and Umar and Aba `Ubaydah decided to swear \nallegiance to Abu Bakr. They had just come forward when Bashir first of \nall put his hand on that of Abu Bakr and after that `Umar and Abu \nUbaydah swore the allegiance. Then the people of Bashr’s tribe came and \nswore allegiance and trampled Sa`d ibn Abadah under their feet. \n \nDuring this time Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was occupied in the \nfuneral bath and burial of the Prophet (h). When afterwards he heard \nabout the assembly at the saqifa and came to know that the Muhajirun had \nwon the score over the Ansar by pleading themselves to be from the tribe \nof the Prophet (h), he uttered the fine sentence that those who argued on \nthe lineal tree spoiled its fruits. That is, if the Muhajirun’s claim was \nacceded for being from the lineal tree of the Prophet (h), how can those \nwho are the fruits of this tree be ignored? It is strange that Abu Bakr who \nconnects with the Prophet (h) in the seventh generation above and `Umar \nwho connects with him in theninth generation above may be held of the \ntribe and family of the Prophet (h) and he who was his first cousin is \nrefused the status of a brother."

This is without reproach to Muhammad \nibn Abu Bakr as I loved him and had raised him. \n \nMuhammad ibn Abu Bakr’s mother was Asma’ daughter of \nUmays whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) married after Abu Bakr’s \ndeath. Consequently, Muhammad (h) lived and was brought up under \nthe care of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and he imbibed his ways and \nmanners. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) loved him and regarded him as his \nson, saying, “Muhammad (h) is my son from Abu Bakr. He was born in \nthe journey during the last Hajj (of the Prophet (h)) and died as a martyr \nin 38 A.H. at the age of twenty eight years. \n \nOn accession to the Caliphate, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had \nselected Qays ibn Sa`d ibn Abadah as the Governor of Egypt but \ncircumstances developed so that he had to be removed. Muhammad ibn \nAbu Bakr was then sent there as Governor. The policy of Qays there was \nthat he did not want to take any serious step against the Othman group but \nMuhammad’s view was different. After the lapse of a month he sent them \nword that in case they did not obey him their existence there would be \nimpossible. Upon this these people organized a front against him and \nengaged themselves in secret wire pulling, but became conspicuous soon. \nAfter arbitration they started creating trouble with the slogan of \nvengeance. This polluted the atmosphere of Egypt. When Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) came to know these deteriorated conditions he gave the \ngovernorship of Egypt to Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar and sent him off \nthere in order that he might suppress insurgent elements and save the \nadministration from getting worse. Yet, he could not escape the evil \ndesigns of the Umayyads and was killed by poison while on his way. \nThus, the governorship of Egypt remained with Muhammad ibn Abu \nBakr.\nOn this side, the performance of Amr ibn al-As in connection \nwith the arbitration made Mu`awiyah recall his own promise. \nConsequently, he gave him six thousand combatants and set him off to \nattack Egypt. When Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr knew of the advancing \nforce of the enemy he wrote to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) for help. \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) replied that he would be soon collecting help \nfor him but in the meantime he should mobilize his own forces. \nMuhammad mobilized four thousand men under his banner and divided \nthem into two formations. He kept one part with himself and on the other \nhe placed Kinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi in command and ordered him to go \nforward to check the enemy’s advance. When they settled down to camp \nbefore the enemy, various parties of the enemy began attacking them. Yet, \nthey faced them with courage and valour. At last, Mu`awiyah ibn Hudayj \nas-Sikuni al-Kindi made an assault with full force. These people did not \nturn away from the enemy’s swords but faced them steadfastly and fell as \nmartyrs in action. The effect of this defeat was that Muhammad ibn Abu \nBakr’s men got frightened and deserted him. Finding himself alone, \nMuhammad fled and sought refuge in a deserted place. The enemy \nhowever got news about him through someone and traced him out when \nhe was dying with thirst. Muhammad asked for water but these cruel men \nrefused and butchered him thirsty. Then they put his body in the belly of a \ndead ass and burnt it. \n \nMalik ibn Ka`b al-Arhabi had already left Kufa with two \nthousand men, but before he could reach Egypt it had been occupied by \nthe enemy."

So they spoke to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) about \nhim and he released him. Then they said, “O Imam Ali! Marwan \ndesires to swear his allegiance to you, whereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) said the following:\n \nDid he not swear me allegiance after the killing of Othman? Now \nI do not need his allegiance because his is the hand of a Jew. If he swears \nme allegiance with his hand he would violate it after a short while. Well, \nhe is to get power for so long as a dog licks his nose. He is the father of \nfour rams (who will also rule).

Due to a thin body and tall stature he was known with the \nnickname “Khayt Batil” (thread of falsehood). When `Abdul-Malik ibn \nMarwan killed `Amr ibn Sa’id al-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn Sa’id \nsaid the following: “O sons of Khayt al-Batil (the thread of wrongdoing)! \nYou have played deceit on `Amr and people like you build their houses \n(of authority) on deceit and treachery.” \n \nAlthough his father, al-Hakam ibn Abul-As, had accepted Islam \nat the time of the fall of Mecca, his behavior and activities caused a great \ndeal of pain to the Prophet (h). Consequently, the Prophet (h) cursed \nhim and his descendants and said, “Woe will befall my people from the \nprogeny of this man.” At last in view of his increasing intrigues, the \nProphet (h) exiled him from Medina towards the valley of Hajj (in Ta’if) \nand Marwan also went with him. Thereafter, the Prophet (h) did not \nallow them to enter Medina as long as he was alive. Abu Bakr and Umar \ndid likewise, but Othman sent for both of them during his reign and raised \nMarwan to such a height as though the reins of caliphate rested in his \nhands. Thereafter his circumstances became so favorable that on the death \nof Mu`awiyah ibn Yazid he became the Caliph of the Muslims. He had \nonly ruled nine months and eighteen days before death overtook him in \nsuch a way that his wife sat with the pillow on his face and did not leave \nuntil he breathe d his last. \n \nThe four sons to whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has referred \nwere the four sons of Abdul-Malik ibn Marwan namely al-Walid, \nSulayman, Yazid and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate one after the \nother and colored the, pp. of history with their stories. Some \ncommentators have regarded this reference to Marwan’s own sons whose \nnames are Abdul-Malik, Abdul-Aziz, Bishr and Muhammad (h).

If you set out at this time, then instead of victory and success you \nwill face defeat and be vanquished.” But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) paid no heed \nto his view and ordered the army to march that very moment. As a result, the \nKharijites suffered such a clear defeat that out of their nine thousand combatants \nonly nine individuals saved their lives by running away while the rest were killed. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has argued about astrology being wrong or \nincorrect in three ways. Firstly, if the view of an astrologer is accepted as correct it \nwould mean falsification of the Holy Quran. An astrologer claims to ascertain \nhidden things of failure by seeing the stars while the Holy Quran says the \nfollowing: \n \nSay: “None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knows the unseen save \nAllah” (27: 65). \n \nSecondly, under his misconception, the astrologer believes that he can \nknow his benefit or harm through knowing the future. In that case it would be \nuseless to turn to Allah and seek His help; while this indifference towards Allah and \nself-reliance is a sort of heresy and atheism, which puts an end to his hope in Allah. \nThirdly, if he succeeds in any objective, he would regard this success to be the \nresult of his knowledge of astrology, the results from which he would praise \nhimself rather than Allah and will expect that whomever he guides (in this manner) \nwould necessarily be grateful to him rather than to Allah. These points do not apply \nto astrology to the extent it may be believed that the astrological findings are in the \nnature of effect of medicines which are subject to alteration at will of Allah. The \ncompetence achieved by most of our religious scholars in astrology is correct in this \nvery ground that they did not regard its findings as final. \nDo you think you can tell the hour when a man goes out and no \nevil will befall him or can warn of the time at which if one goes out harm \nwill accrue? Whoever testifies to this, falsifies the Holy Quran and \nbecomes unmindful of Allah in achieving his desired objective and in \nwarding off the undesirable. You cherish saying this so that he who acts \non what you say should praise you rather than Allah because according to \nyour misconception you have guided him about the hour in which he \nwould secure benefit and avoid harm. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) then advanced towards the people \nand said the following:\n \nO People! Beware of learning the science of stars except that with \nwhich guidance is sought on land or sea because it leads to divining and \nan astrologer is a the Diviner, while the Diviner is like the sorcerer, the \nsorcerer is like the unbeliever and the unbeliever would be in Hell. \nProceed forward in the Name of Allah."

    "text": "After the Battle of Jamal, Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Said \nthe Following about Physical Defects of Women: \n \nO people! Women are deficient in faith, deficient in shares and \ndeficient in intelligence. As regarding the deficiency in their faith, it is \ntheir abstention from prayers and fasting during their menstrual period. \nAs regarding deficiency in their intelligence it is because the testimony of \ntwo women is equal to that of one man. As for the deficiency of their \nshares that is because of their share in inheritance being half of men. So \nbeware of the evils of women. Be on your guard even from those of them \nwho are (reportedly) good. Do not obey them even in good things so that \nthey may not attract you to evils. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon after the \ndevastation caused by the Battle of Jamal. Since the devastation resulting \nfrom this battle was the outcome of blindly following a woman’s \ncommand, in this sermon, he has described women’s physical defects and \ntheir causes and effects. Thus their first weakness is that for a few days in \nevery month they have to abstain from prayer and fasting and this \nabstention from worship is a proof of their deficiency in faith. Although \nthe real meaning of Iman (belief) is heart-felt testimony and an inner \nconviction, yet metaphorically, it also applies to action and character. \nSince actions are the reflection of belief, they are also regarded as part of \nbelief. Thus, it is related from Imam Ali ibn Musa ar Rida (x) that: “Iman \n(belief) is a testimony at heart, an admission by the tongue and action by \nthe limbs. \n \nThe second weakness is that their natural propensities do not \nadmit the full performance of their intelligence. Therefore, nature has \ngiven them the power of intelligence only in accordance with the scope of \ntheir activities which can guide them in pregnancy, delivery, child \nnursing, child care and household affairs. On the basis of this weakness of \nmind and intelligence their testimony has not been accorded the status of \nman’s testimony, as Allah says the following: \n... Then call to witnesses two witness from among your men and \nif there not be two men then (take) a man for two women, of those you \napprove of the witnesses, so that should one of the two (women) forget \nthe (second) one of the two may remind the other. (Holy Quran, 2: 282) \n \nThe third weakness is that their share in inheritance is half of \nman’s share in inheritance as the Holy Quran says the following: \nAllah enjoins you regarding your children. The male shall have \nequal to the shares of two females. (Holy Quran, 4: 11) \n \nThis shows woman’s weakness because the reason for her share \nin inheritance being half is that the liability of her maintenance rests on \nman. When man’s status is that of a maintainer and caretaker the status of \nthe weaker gender who is in need of maintenance and care-taking is \nevident.\n \nAfter describing their natural weakness as Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) points out the mischief of blindly following them and wrongly \nobeying them. He says that not to say of bad things but even if they say \nwith regard to some good things it should not be done in a way that these \nshould feel as if it is being done in pursuance of their wish. Rather it \nshould be done in a way that they should realize that the good act has \nbeen performed because of its being good and that their pleasure or wish \nhas nothing to do with it. If they have even the doubt that their pleasures \nhas been kept in view in it they would slowly increase in their demands \nand would wish that they should be obeyed in all matters however evil, \nthe inevitable consequence whereof will be destruction and ruin. Shaikh \nMuhammad Abdo writes about this view of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nas under:\n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has said what is corroborated by the \nexperiences of centuries."

    "text": "About the World and its People \n \nHow shall I describe this world whose beginning is grief and \nwhose end is destruction?146\n \n146The beginning of the world is grief and its end is destruction. This sentence \ncontains the same truth which the Holy Quran has presented in the verse saying, \n“Indeed We have created man (to dwell) amid hardship” (90: 4). \n \nIt is true that right from the narrow womb of the mother and unto the \nvastness of the firmament the changes of human life do not come to an end. \nWhen man first tastes life he finds himself closed in such a dark prison where he \ncan neither move the limbs nor change the sides. When he gets rid of this \nconfinement and steps in this world he has to pass through innumerable troubles. \nIn the beginning he can neither speak with the tongue so as to describe his \ndifficulty or pain nor does he possess energy in the limbs so as to accomplish his \nneeds himself. Only his suppressed sobs and flowing tears express his needs and \ntranslate his grief and sorrow. When after the laps of this period he enters the \nstage of learning and instruction, then on every step voices of admonition and \nabuse welcome him. All the time he seems frightened and terrified. When he is \nrelieved of this period of subjugation he finds himself surrounded by the worries \nof family life and livelihood, where sometime, there is clash with comrades in \nprofession, sometimes collision with enemies, sometimes confrontation with \nvicissitudes of time, sometimes attack of ailments and sometimes the shock of \nchildren. Then old age approaches him with the tidings of helplessness and \n The lawful actions performed here have to be accounted for, \nwhile for the forbidden one there is punishment. Whoever is rich here \nfaces mischief and whoever is poor gets grief. One who hankers after it \ndoes not get it. If one keeps away from it then it advances towards him. If \none sees through it, it would bestow him sight, but if one has his eye on it \nthen it would blind him. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “If a thinker thinks over this \nphrase of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) waman absara biha bassarat’hu (If \none sees through it, it would bestow him sight), he would find the rein a \nvery amazing meaning and far-reaching sense the purpose of which \ncannot be appreciated and whose aim cannot be understood particularly \nwhen he joins it with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s phrase waman absara \nilayha a a`matahu (If one has his eye on it, then it would blind him), he \n \nweakness and eventually he bids farewell to this world with mortification and \ngrief in the heart. \n \nThereafter Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says about this world, that within \nits lawful actions there is the question of reckoning and in its forbidden acts there \nare hardships of punishment, as a result of which even pleasant joys also produce \nbitterness in his palate. If there is plenty of wealth and money in this world then \nman finds himself in such a whirlpool (of worries) that he loses his joy and peace \nof mind. But if there is want and poverty, he is ever crying for wealth. For he \nwho hankers after this world there is no limit to his desires. If one wish is \nfulfilled the desire for fulfillment of another wish crops up. This world is like the \nreflection. If you run after it then it will itself run forward but if you leave it and \nrun away from it then it follows you. In the same way, if a person does not run \nafter the world, the world runs after him. The implication is that if a person \nbreaks the clutches of greed and avarice and keeps aloof from undesirable \nhankering after the world, he too gets (pleasure of) the world and he does not \nremain deprived of it. Therefore, he who surveys this world from above its \nsurface and takes lesson from its changes and happenings and through its \nvariation and alterations gains knowledge about Allah’s Might, Wisdom and \nSagacity, Mercy, Clemency and Sustaining power, his eyes will gain real \nbrightness and sight. On the other hand the person who is lost only in the \ncolorfulness of the world and its decorations, loses himself in the darkness of the \nworld. This is why Allah has forbidden to view the world thus: \nAnd strain not thine eyes unto that which We have provided (different) \nparties of them, (of) the splendor of the life of this world, so that We may try \nthem in it; for the provision of your Lord is better and more abiding (Holy Quran, \n20: 131). \nwould find the difference between absara biha and absara laha, clear, \nbright, wonderful and shining.”"

He is the Giver of all rewards and \ndistinction and Dispeller of all calamities and hardships. I praise Him for \nHis continuous mercy and His copious bounties. \n \nI believe in Him as He is the First of all and He is Manifest. I \nseek guidance from Him as He is Near and is the Guide. I seek His succor \nas He is Mighty and the Subduer. I depend upon Him as He is the Sufficer \nand Supporter. And I testify that Muhammad (h) (blessing of Allah be \non him and his progeny) is His slave and His Prophet (h). He sent him \nfor enforcement of His commands, for exhausting His pleas and for \npresenting warnings (against eternal punishment). \nEnjoining People to be Pious: \n \nO servants of Allah! I admonish you to fear Allah Who has \nfurnished illustrations and Who has timed for you your lives. He has \ngiven you the covering of outfit147 and He has scattered for you \nlivelihood. He has surrounded you with His knowledge. He has ordained \nrewards. He has bestowed upon you vast bounties and extensive gifts. He \nhas warned you through far reaching arguments and He has counted you \nby numbers. He has fixed for you ages (to live) in this place of test and \nhouse of instruction. \n \n147Allah has furnished every creature with a natural outfit: The means of \nprotecting it from cold and heat. Thus, some animals are covered in feathers \nwhile some carry apparels of wool on their bodies. But the high degree of \nintelligence of man and the quality of being timid and modest demands his \ndistinction from other creatures. Consequently, to maintain this distinction, he \nhas been taught the ways of covering his body. It was this natural impulse when \nAdam was made to give up his outfit he began to cover his body with leaves. The \nHoly Quran says the following: \nCautioning Against this World: \n \nYou are tested in this world and have to render an accounting. \nCertainly this world is a dirty watering place and a muddy source of \ndrinking. \n \nIts appearance is attractive and its inside is destructive. It is a \ndelible deception, a vanishing reflection and a bent pillar. When its \ndespiser begins to like it and he who is not acquainted with it feels \nsatisfied with it, then it praises and puts down its feet (in joy). It entraps \nhim in its trap, makes him the target of its arrows and puts round his neck \nthe rope of death taking him to the narrow grave and fearful abode in \norder to show him his place of stay and the recompense of his acts. This \ngoes on from generation to generation. Neither death stops from cutting \nthem asunder nor do the survivors keep aloof from committing sins. \nDeath and Resurrection: \n \nThey are emulating each other and proceeding in groups towards \nthe final objective and the rendezvous of death, till when matters come to \na close, the world dies and resurrection draws near. Allah148 will take \n \nSo when they tasted (of) the tree their shameful things got displayed \nunto them and they began covering themselves with leaves of the Garden.(Holy \nQuran, 7: 22) \nThis was the punishment awarded for his committing what was better for him to \nomit. When removal of outfit is punishment its putting on would be a favor and \nsince this is peculiar to man it has been particularly mentioned. \n148The intention is that Allah would resurrect all the dead, even though \nthey had been eaten by beasts and been merged in their bodies. Its aim is to refute \nthe view of the philosophers who hold that the resurrection of the non-existent is \nimpossible and who do not believe in the physical resurrection. Their argument \nbriefly is that a thing which has lost existence by death cannot return to life. \nConsequently, after the destruction of this world the return of any of its beings to \nlife is out of question. But the belief is not correct because dispersal of the parts \ndoes not mean its non-existence, so as to say that putting these parts together \nagain would involve resurrection of the non-existent. On the other hand separated \nand dispersed parts continue to exist in some form or the other. Of course, in this \nconnection this objection has some force that when every person is to be \nresurrected in his own form, then in case one person has eaten the other, it would \nbe impossible to resurrect either of them with his own constituent parts. This \nwould involve creating a deficiency of parts in he who had eaten the other. \nthem out from the corners of the graves, the birds’ nests, the beasts’ dens \nand the centers of death. They will hasten towards His command and run \ntowards the place fixed for their final return group by group, quiet, \nstanding and arrayed in rows. They will be within Allah’s sight and He \nwill hear everyone whom He calls. \n \nThey will be wearing the outfit of helplessness and the covering \nof submission and indignity. (At this time) contrivances will disappear, \ndesires will be cut, hearts will quietly sink, voices will be curbed, sweat \nwill choke the throat, fear will increase and ears will resound with the \nthundering voice of the announcer calling them towards final judgement, \nawarding recompense, striking with punishment and paying rewards. \nThe Limitation of Life: \n \nPeople have been created as a proof of (His) power. They have \nbeen brought up with authority, they are made to die through pangs and \nplaced in graves where they turn into crumbs. Then they will be \nresurrected one by one, awarded their recompense and will have to \naccount for their actions, each one separately. They had been allowed \ntime to seek deliverance, had been shown the right path and had been \nallowed to live and seek favors. The darkness of doubts had been \nremoved. They had been let free in this period of life as a training place in \norder to make preparation for the race on the Day of Judgement, to search \nfor the objective with thoughtfulness, to get time necessary to secure \nbenefits and provide for the next place of stay. \nNo Happiness without Piety: \n \nHow appropriate are these illustrations and effective admonitions \nprovided they are received by pure hearts, open ears, firm views and sharp \nwits. Fear Allah like him who listened (from good advice) and bowed \nbefore it, when he committed sin he admitted it, when he felt fear he acted \nvirtuously. When he apprehended he hastened (towards good deeds), \nwhen he believed he performed virtuous acts, when he was asked to take \nlesson (from the happenings of this world) he learned. When he was \n \n \nMetaphysicians have replied that in everybody there are some \nconstituents which are essential and others which are non-essential. The essential \nconstituents remain constant from the beginning till end of life and suffer no \nchange or alteration and resurrection with regard to such constituents would not \ncreate any deficiency in the man who ate the other. \nasked to desist he abstained (from evil), when he responded to the call (of \nAllah) he leaned (towards him), when he turned back (to evil) he \nrepented, when he followed he almost imitated and when he was shown \n(the right path) he saw it. \n \nSuch a man was busy in search of truth and got rid (of the worldly \nevils) by running away. He collected provision (of good deeds) for \nhimself, purified his inner self, built for the next world and took provision \nfor the day of his departure, keeping in view his journey, his requirement \nand the status of his need. He sent ahead for the abode of his stay (in the \nnext world). O servants of Allah!, fear Allah keeping in view the reason \nwhy He created you and be afraid of Him to the extent He has advised \nyou to do. Make yourself deserve what He has promised you, by having \nconfidence in the truth of His promise and entertaining fear for the Day of \nJudgement.\nPart of the Same Sermon: Reminding People of Allah’s \nBounties\n \nHe has made for you ears to preserve what is important, eyes to \nhave sight in place of blindness and limbs which consist of many \n(smaller) parts, whose curves are in proportion with the molding of their \nshapes and lengths of their ages. He has also given you bodies that sustain \nthemselves and hearts that are busy in search of their food, besides other \nbig bounties, obliging the bestowing (of His blessings) and a fortress of \nsafety. He has fixed for you ages that are not known to you. He has \nretained for you remains of the past people for your instruction. Those \npeople enjoyed themselves fully and were completely unhampered. Death \novertook them before (satisfaction of) their desires, from which the hands \nof death separated them. They did not provide for themselves during the \nhealth of their bodies nor take lessons during the stages of youth. \n \nAre these people who are in youth waiting for the back-bending \nof old age, those enjoying fresh health waiting for ailments and these \nliving persons looking for the hour of death? When the hour of departure \ncomes closer, the journey is at hand with pangs of grief and trouble. \nWhen the suffering of sorrows, suffocation of saliva and the time would \narrive for calling relations and friends for help and changing sides on the \nbed, could then thenear ones stop death, or themourning women do any \ngood? He would rather be left alone in the graveyard confined to \nthenarrow corner of his grave. \nHis skin has been pierced all over by reptiles and his freshness \nhas been destroyed by these tribulations. Storms have removed his traces \nand calamities have obliterated even his signs. Fresh bodies have turned \nthin and withe red and bones have become rotten. The spirits are \nburdened with the weight of sins and have become conscious of the \nunknown things. But now neither the good deeds can be added to nor evil \nacts can be atoned for by repentance. Are you not sons, fathers, brothers \nand relations of these dead and will you not follow their footsteps and \npass by their paths? But hearts are still unmoved, heedless of guidance \nand moving on wrong lines, as though the addressee is someone else and \nthe correct way is to amass worldly gains. \nPrepare Yourself for the Day of Judgement: \n \nAnd be informed that you have to pass over the pathway (of Sirat) \nwhere steps waver, feet slip, and there are fearful dangers at every step. O \nservants of Allah! Fear Allah like the fearing of a wise man whom the \nthought (of next world) has turned away from other matters. The fear (of \nAllah) has afflicted his body with trouble and pain, his engagement in the \nnight prayer has turned even his short sleep into awakening, hope (of \neternal recompense) keeps him thirsty in the day, abstention has curbed \nhis desires and remembrance of Allah is ever moving his tongue. He \nentertains fear before dangers. He avoids uneven ways in favor of clear \nones. He follows the shortest route to secure his purpose, wishfulness \ndoes not twist his thinking and ambiguities do not blind his eyes. He \nenjoys deep sleep and passes his day happily because of the happiness of \ngood tidings and pleasure of (eternal bounties). \n \nHe passes the pathway of this world in a praiseworthy manner. \nHe reaches the Hereafter with virtues. He hastens (towards virtue) out of \nfear (for vice). He moves briskly during the short time (of life in this \nworld). He devotes himself in seeking (eternal good), he runs away from \nevil. During today he is mindful of tomorrow and keeps the future in his \nview. Certainly Paradise is the best reward and achievement, which hell is \nappropriate punishment and suffering. Allah is the best Avenger and \nHelper and the Holy Quran is the best argument and the best to confront \n(them). \nWarning Against Satan: \n \nI enjoin upon you fear of Allah Who has left no excuse against \nwhat He has warned, has exhausted argument (of guidance) about the \n(right) path He has shown. He has warned you of the enemy that steals \ninto hearts and stealthily speaks into ears and thereby misguides and \nbrings about destruction, makes (false) promises and keeps under wrong \nimpression. He represents evil sins in attractive shape and shows as light \neven serious crimes. When he has deceived his comrades and exhausted \nthe pledge he begins to find fault with what he presented as good and \nconsiders serious what he had shown as light and threatens from what he \nhad shown as safe. \nPart of the Same Sermon Dealing with Creation of Man \n \nOr look at man whom Allah has created in the dark wombs and \nlayers of curtains an from what was overflowing semen, then a shapeless \nclot, then embryo, then a suckling infant, then a child then a fully grown \nyoung man. Then He gave him heart with a memory, a tongue to talk and \neyes to see with in order that he may take lesson (from whatever is around \nhim), understand, follow the admonition and abstain from evil. \n \nWhen he attained the normal growth and his structure gained its \naverage development, he fell in self-conceit and became perplexed. He \ndrew buckets of desires, became immersed in fulfilling his wishes for \npleasures of the world and his (sordid) aims. He did not fear any evil nor \nbecame frightened of any apprehension. He died infatuated with his vices. \nHe spent his short life in rubbish pursuits. He earned no reward nor did he \nfulfil any obligation. Fatal illness overtook him while he was still in his \nenjoyments and perplexed him. He passed the night in the wakefulness of \nthe hardships of grief and the pricking of pains and ailments. He suffered \nin the presence of real brother, loving father, wailing mother and crying \nsister, while he himself was under a maddening uneasiness, serious \nsenselessness, fearful cries, suffocating pains, anguish of suffocating \nsufferings and the pangs of death. \n \nThereafter, he was clad in the shroud while he remained quiet and \nthoroughly submissive to others. Then he was placed on planks in such a \nstate that he had been down-trodden by hardships and thinned by \nailments. The crowd of young men and helping brothers carried him to his \nhouse of loneliness where all connections of visitors are severed. \nThereafter those who accompanied him went away and those who were \nwailing for him returned. He was made to sit in his grave for a terrifying \nquestioning and a slippery examination. The great calamity of that place \nis the hot water and entry into Hell, flames of eternal Fire and intensity of \nblazes. There is no resting period, no gap for ease, no power to intervene, \nno death to bring about solace and no sleep to make him forget pain. He \nrather lies under several kinds of deaths and moment-to-moment \npunishment. We seek refuge with Allah. \nThe Lesson to Be Learned from Those Who Have Passed \nAway:\n \nO servants of Allah! where are those who were allowed (long) \nages to live and they enjoyed bounty? they were taught and they learned. \nThey were given time and they passed it in vain. They were kept healthy \nand they forgot (their duty). They were allowed a long period (of life), \nwere handsomely provided, were warned of grievous punishment and \nwere promised big rewards. You should avoid sins that lead to destruction \nand vices that attract the wrath (of Allah). \n \nO people who possess eyes and ears, health and wealth! Is there \nany place of protection, any shelter of safety, or asylum or haven, or \noccasion to run away or to come back (to this world) ? If not, Ahow are \nyou then turned away (Holy Quran, 6: 95; 10: 34; 35: 3; 40: 62) and \nwhither are you averting? By what things have you been deceived? \nCertainly, the share of everyone of you from this earth is just a piece of \nland equal to his owns stature and size where he would lie on his cheeks \ncovered with dust. The present is an opportune moment for acting. \n \nO servants of Allah! Since the neck is free from the loop and \nspirit is also unfettered, now you have time for seeking guidance. You are \nin ease of body; you can assemble in crowds, the rest of life is before you; \nyou have opportunity of acting by will; there is opportunity for repentance \nand peaceful circumstances. (But you should act) before you are \novertaken by narrow circumstances and distress, or fear and weakness, \nbefore the approach of the awaited death and before seizure by the \nAlmighty, the Powerful. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “It is related that when Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon people began to tremble, tears \nflowed from their eyes and their hearts were frightened. Some people call \nthis sermon the Brilliant Sermon (al-Khutbatul-Gharra’).”"

He is the First, such that nothing was before Him. He is \nthe Last, such that there is no limit for Him. Imagination cannot catch any \n \n149Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) here refers to the incident when the \nConqueror of Egypt, Amr ibn al-As, exhibited the “feat of his courage” by \ndisplaying his private parts! What happened was that when in the battlefield of \nSiffin he and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had an encounter, he rendered himself \nnaked in order to ward off the blow of the sword. At this Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) turned his face away and spared him his life. The famous Arab poet al-\nFarazdaq said about it: “There is no good in warding off trouble by ignominy as \nwas done one day by Amr ibn al-As by exposing his private parts.” Even in this \nignoble act `Amr ibn al-As had not the credit of doing it himself, but had rather \nfollowed another who had preceded him because the man who first adopted this \ndevice was Talhah ibn Abu Talhah who had saved his life in the battle of Uhud \nby becoming naked before Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and so he showed this \nway to the others. Thus, besides Amr ibn al-As trick was played by Bisr ibn Abu \nArta’ah also to save himself from the sword of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). \nWhen after the performance of this notable deed Bisr went to Mu`awiyah the \nlatter recalled Amr ibn al-As act as precedent in order to remove this man’s \nshamefulness and said, “O Bisr, no matter. There is nothing to feel shameful \nabout it in view of `Amr ibn al-As’s precedent before you.” \nof His qualities. Hearts cannot entertain belief about His nature. Analysis \nand division cannot be applied to Him. Eyes and hearts cannot compare \nHim. \nPart of the Same Sermon: \n \nO servants of Allah! Take lesson from useful items of instruction \nand shining indications. Be cautioned by effective items of warning. Get \nbenefit from preaching and admonition. It is as though the claws of death \nare pressed in you, the connection of hope and desires has been cut \nasunder, hard affairs have befallen you and your march is towards the \nplace where everyone has to go, namely death. Hence, with every person \nthere is a driver and a witness (Holy Quran, 50: 21). The driver drives him \ntowards resurrection while the witness furnishes testimony about his \ndeeds.\nPart of the same sermon (about Paradise): \n \n \n \nIn Paradise, there are high classes and different abodes. Its \nboundary never ends. He who stays in it will never depart from it. He who \nis endowed with everlasting abode in it will not get old and its resident \nwill not face want."

    "text": "About Getting Ready for the next World and Following \nAllah’s Commandments:\n \nAllah knows hidden matters and is aware of inner feelings. He \nencompasses everything. He has control over everything and power over \neverything. Everyone of you should do whatever he has to do during his \ndays of life before the approach of death. In its leisure before his \noccupation and during the breathing of his breath before it is overtaken by \nsuffocation, he should provide for himself and his journey and should \ncollect provisions from his place of halt for his place of stay. \n \nSo remember Allah, O people! about what He has asked you in \nHis Book to take care of and about His rights that He has entrusted to you. \nVerily, Allah has not created you in vain nor left you unbridled nor let \nyou alone in ignorance and gloom. He has defined what you should leave \nbehind, taught you your acts, ordained your death and sent down the Book \n(Holy Quran) explaining everything (Holy Quran, 16: 89). He has made \nHis Prophet (h) live among you for a long time till He completed for him \nand for you a message sent through the Holy Quran__namely the religion \nliked and clarified through him His good and evil acts, His prohibitions \nand His commands. \n \nHe placed before you His arguments and exhausted his excuses \nupon you. He put forth to you His promises and warned you of severe \nretribution. You should, therefore, make full atonement during your \nremaining days and let yourselves practice endurance in these days. These \ndays are fewer as against the many days during which you have shown \nobliviousness and heedlessness towards admonition. Do not allow time to \nyourselves because it will put you on the path of wrong-doers and do not \nbe easy-going because this will push you towards sinfulness. \n \nO servants of Allah! The best advise for himself is he who is the \nmost obedient to Allah and the most deceiving for himself is he who is the \nmost disobedient to Allah. Deceived is he who deceived his own self. \nEnviable is he whose faith is safe. Fortunate is he who takes lessons from \nothers, while unfortunate is he who falls victim to his desires. You should \nknow that even the smallest hypocrisy is like believing in more than one \nAllah and keeping company of people who follow their desires is the key \nto obliviousness from religion and is the seat of Satan. \n \nBe on your guard against falsehood because it is contrary to faith. \nA truthful person is on the height of salvation and dignity, while the liar is \non the edge of ignominy and degradation. Do not be jealous because \njealousy eats away faith just as fire eats away dried wood. Do not bear \nmalice because it is a scraper (of virtues).

    "text": "Qualities of a Faithful Believer: \n \nO servants of Allah! The most fearful of Allah is one whom Allah \nhas given power (to act) against his own passions, so that his inner side is \n(submerged in) grief and the outside is covered with fear. The lamp of \nguidance is burning in his heart. He has provided entertainment for the \nday that is to befall him. He regards what is distant to be near himself and \ntakes the dark to be light. He looks at and perceives; he remembers \n(Allah) and enhances (the tempo of his) actions. He drinks sweet water to \nwhose source his way has been made easy. So he drinks to satisfaction \nand takes the level path. He has taken off the clothe s of desires and has \nrid himself of worries except one worry peculiar to him. He is safe from \nmisguidance and the company of people who follow their passions. He \nhas become the key to the doors of guidance’ and the lock for the doors of \ndestruction.\n \nHe has seen his way and is walking on it. He knows his pillar (of \nguidance) and has crossed over his deep water. He has caught hold of the \nmost reliable supports and the strongest ropes. He is on that level of \nconviction which is like the brightness of the sun. He has set himself for \nAllah, the Glorified One, for performance of the most sublime acts by \nfacing all that befalls him and takes every step needed for it. He is the \nlamp in darkness. He is the dispeller of all blindness, key to the obscure, \nremover of complexities and a guide in vast deserts. When he speaks he \n(makes himself understood) whereas when he remains silent then it is safe \nto do so. He does everything only for Allah and so Allah also makes him \nHis own. Consequently, he is like the mines of His faith and a stump in \nHis earth. He has enjoined upon himself (to follow) justice. \n \nThe first step of his justice is the rejection of desires from his \nheart. He describes right and acts according to it. There is no good which \nhe has not aimed at nor any likely place (of virtue) of the Holy Quran., \ntherefore, the Holy Quran is his guide and leader. He gets down when the \nHoly Quran puts down his weight and he settles where the Holy Quran \nsettles him down. \nCharacteristics of an Unfaithful Believer:\n \nWhile the other (kind of) man is he who calls himself learned but \nhe is not so. He has gleaned ignorance from the ignorant and misguidance \nfrom the misguided. He has set for the people a trap (made) of the ropes \nof deceit and untrue speech. He takes the Holy Quran according to his \nown views and right after his passions. He makes people feel safe from \nbig sins and takes light the serious crimes. He says that he is waiting for \n(clarification) of doubts but he remains plunged the rein and that he keeps \naloof from innovations but actually he is immersed in them. His shape is \nthat of a man, but his heart is that of a beast. He does not know the door \nof guidance to follow nor the door of misguidance to keep aloof \ntherefrom. These are the living-dead bodies. \nAbout the Descendants (Itra) of the Holy Prophet (h):\n \nSo where are you going?! (Holy Quran, 81: 26); How are you \nthen turned away?! (Holy Quran, 6: 95; 10: 34; 35: 3; 40: 62). Ensigns (of \nguidance) are standing, indications (of virtue) are clear and the minarets \n(of light) have been fixed. Where are you being taken astray and how are \nyou groping while you have among you the descendants of the Prophet \n(h) ? they are the reins of Right, ensigns of Faith and tongues of truth. \nAccord to them the same good status as you accord to the Holy Quran and \ncome to them (for quenching the thirst of guidance) as the thirsty camels \napproach the water spring. \n \nO people take this saying of the last of the prophets that he who \ndies from among us is not dead and he who decays (after dying) from \namong us does not really decay. Do not say what you do not understand \nbecause most of the Right is in what you deny. Accept the argument of \none against whom you have no argument. It is I. Did I not act before you \non the greater thiqal (ath-thiqal al-akbar, i.e. The Holy Quran) and did I \nnot retain among you smaller thiqal (ath-thiqal al-asghar, i.e. the \ndescendants of the Prophet [h]) ? I fixed among you the standard of faith \nand I taught you the limits of lawful and unlawful. I clothed you with the \ngarments of safety with my justice and spread for you (the carpet of) \nvirtue by my words and deeds. \n \nI showed you high manners through myself. Do not exercise your \nimagination about what the eye cannot see or the mind cannot conceive. \nPart of the Same Sermon about Banu Umayyah: \n \nTill people begin thinking that the world is attached to the \nUmayyads, would be showering its benefits to them and lead them to its \nclear spring for watering and that their whip and sword will not be \nremoved from the people. Whoever thinks which they would suck for a \nwhile then vomit out the whole of it. \n \nThe hadith of the Prophet (h) referred to above is a definite \nproof of the view that the life of any one from among Ahlul-Bayt (x)\n(Household of the Holy Prophet [h]) does not come to an end. It is \napparent that death makes no difference in their sense of living, although \nthe human intelligence is unable to comprehend the conditions and \nhappenings of that life. There are many truths beyond the world of senses \nwhich the human mind cannot yet understand. Who can say how, in the \nnarrow corner of the grave where it is not possible even to breath, replies \nwill be given to the questions of the angels Munkar and Nakir? Similarly, \nwhat is the meaning of life of the martyrs in the cause of Allah, who have \nneither sense nor motion, can neither see nor hear? Although to us they \nappear to be dead, yet the Holy Quran testifies to their life. \nAnd say not of those who are slain in the path of Allah that they \nare dead; Nay, (they are) living, but you perceive not. (Holy Quran, 2: \n154)\nAt another place, He (Allah) says the following about their life: \nReckon not those who are slain in the way of Allah, to be dead; \nNay! alive they are with their Master being sustained. (Holy Quran, 3: \n169)\n \nWhen restriction has been placed on the minds and tongues even \nwith regard to the common martyrs that they should not be called dead \nnor considered dead, how would not those individuals whose necks were \nreserved for swords and plates of poison be living for all times to come? \n \nAbout their bodies, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has said that by \nthe passage of time no signs of oldness or decay occur in them, but they \nremain in the same state in which they fell as martyrs. There should be \nnothing strange in it because dead bodies preserved through material \nmeans still exit. When it is possible to do so through material means will \nit be out of the Power of the Omnipotent Creator to preserve against \nchange and decay the bodies of those upon whom he has bestowed the \nsense of everlasting life? Thus about the martyrs of Badr, the Holy \nProphet (h) said the following: “Shroud them even with their wounds \nand flowing blood because when they would rise on the Day of \nJudgement blood would be pushing out of their throats.” \n \nAl-thiqal al-akbar implies the Holy Quran, while Al-thiqal al-\nasghar means Ahl al-Bayt (x) (Household of the Holy Prophet [h]) as in \nthe Prophet’s saying: “Verily, I am leaving among you (the ) two precious \nthings (of high estimation and of care), the reference is to Holy Quran and \nAhl al-Bayt (x).” There are several reasons for using this word. Firstly, \nAl-thiqal means the kit of a traveller; since the kit is greatly in need, it is \nprotected carefully. Secondly, it means a precious thing; since this is of a \ngreat importance, one is bound to follow the injunctions of the Holy \nQuran and the actions of Ahl al-Bayt (x) in its regard. So, they have been \ncalled “precious things”. Since Allah has made arrangements for the \nprotection of the Holy Quran and Ahl al-Bayt (x) till the Last Day, they \nhave been called al-thaqalayn. The Prophet (h), before leaving this world \nfor the next, declared them to be his valuable possessions, ordering people \nto safeguard them. Thirdly, they have been called al-thaqalayn (two \nprecious things) in view of their purity and high value. Thus ibn Hajar al-\nHaytami writes the following: \n \nThe Prophet (h) has called the Holy Quran and his Descendants \nas al-thaqalayn (the two precious [or weighty] things) because Al-thiqal \nmeans a pure, chaste and preserved thing and either of these two were \nreally so, each of them is the treasure of the Divine knowledge and a \nsource of scholarly secrets and religious commandments. For that reason \nthe Prophet (h) desired the people to follow them and to stick to them \nand to secure knowledge from them. Among them, the most deserving of \nattachment is the Imam and Scholar of the family of the Prophet (h)\nnamely Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah honor his face) because of his great \ninsight and copiousness of knowledge which we have already described; \nrefer to Al-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqa, p.90. \n \nSince the Prophet (h) has, with regard to apparent implication, \nattributed the Holy Quran to Allah and the descendants to himself, in \nkeeping with the natural status the Holy Quran has been called the bigger \nweight while the descendants, the smaller weight.; otherwise, from the \npoint of view of being followed both are equal and from the point of view \nof utility in the development of character there can be no question in the \nstatus of the speaking party (Ahl al-Bayt [x]) being higher than the silent \none (the Holy Quran)."

Even less than what sufferings and \nmisfortunes have yet to fall upon you or have already befallen you are \nenough for giving lessons.

Water had gone underground. The minarets of guidance had \ndisappeared and signs of destruction had appeared. It was stern to its \npeople and frowned in the face of its seeker.

He is the \nOriginator of creation and their Master. He is the Allah of the creation and \nits feeder. The sun and the moon are steadily moving in pursuit of His \nwill. They make every fresh thing old and every distant thing near. \n \nHe distributed their sustenance and has counted their deeds and \nacts, the number of their breaths, their concealed looks and whatever is \nhidden in their bosoms. He knows their places of stay and places of last \nresort in the loins and wombs till they reach their end. \n \nHis punishment on the enemies is harsh despite the extent of His \nMercy and His compassion toward His friends is vast despite His harsh \npunishment. He overpowers one who wants to overcome Him and \ndestroys one who clashes with Him. He disgraces one who opposes Him \nand gains sway over one who bears hostility toward Him.

    "text": "This sermon is known as the sermon of Skeletons150 (Khutbatul-\nAshbah), and it holds one of the highest positions among the sermons of \n \n150The name of this sermon is the sermon of al-Ashbah. Ashbah is the \nplural of shabah which means skeleton, since it contains a description of angels \nand other kinds of beings, it has thus been named. The grounds for being angry \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). Mas`adah ibn Sadaqah has related from \nImam Ja`far ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq (x) saying: “Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) delivered this sermon from the pulpit of (the mosque of) Kufa \nwhen someone asked him, ‘O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)! Describe \nAllah for us in such a way that we may imagine that we see Him with \neyes so that our love and knowledge may increase about Him.’ Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) became angry at this (request of the inquirer) and \nordered the Muslims to gather in the mosque. So many Muslims gathered \nin the mosque that the place was over-crowded. Imam Ali (x) ibn Abu \nTalib (x) ascended the pulpit while he was still in a state of anger and his \ncolor was changed. Having praised and extolled Allah and sought His \nblessings on the Prophet (h), he said the following: \nAbout Allah: \n \nPraise be to Allah Whom refusal to give away and stinginess do \nnot reach and Whom munificence and generosity do not make poor, \nalthough everyone who gives away loses (to that extent) except He and \nevery miser is blamed for his niggardliness. He obliges through beneficial \nbounties and plentiful gifts and grants. The whole creation is His \ndependents (in sustenance). He has guaranteed their livelihood and \nordained their sustenance. He has prepared the way for those who turn to \nHim and those who seek what is with Him. He is as generous about what \nHe is asked as He is about that for which He is not asked. He is the First \nfor whom there was no before so that there could not be anything before \nHim. He is the Last for whom there is no after, so that there could not be \nanything after Him. Time does not change over Him, so as to admit of any \nchange of condition about Him. He is not in any place so as to allow Him \nmovement (from one place to another). \n \nIf He gives away all that the mines of the mountains emit of the \ngold, silver, pearls and cuttings of coral which the shells of the ocean \nvomit out, it would not affect his munificence, nor diminish the extent of \nwhat He has. (In fact) He would still have such treasures of bounty as \nwould not decrease by the demands of the creatures because He is that \ngenerous. Being Whom the begging of beggars cannot make poor nor the \npertinacity of those who beseech make miser. \n \nwith the inquirer was that his request was unconnected with the obligations of \nShar`a and beyond the limits of human capacity. \nAttributes of Allah as Described in the Holy Quran: \n \nThen look at the inquirer, be confined to those of His attributes \nwhich the Holy Quran had described and seek light from the glory of its \nguidance. Leave to Allah that knowledge which Satan has prompted you \nto seek and which neither the Holy Quran enjoins you to seek nor is there \nany trace of it in the actions or sayings of the Prophet (h) and other \nleaders (Imams) of guidance. This is the extreme limit of Allah’s claim \nupon you. Be informed that firm in knowledge are those who refrain from \nopening the curtains that lie against the unknown and their \nacknowledgment of ignorance about the details of the hidden unknown \nprevents them from further probing. Allah praises them for their \nadmission that they are unable to get knowledge not allowed to them. \nThey do not go deep into the discussion of what is not enjoined upon \nthem about knowing Him and they call it firmness. Be content with this \nand do not limit the Greatness of Allah after the measure of your own \nintelligence, or else you would be among the destroyed ones. \n \nHe is Powerful, such that when the imagination shoots its arrows \nto comprehend the extremity of His power, the mind, making itself free of \nthe dangers of evil thoughts tries to find Him in the depth of His realm, \nthe hearts long to grasp realities of His attributes and the openings of \nintelligence penetrate beyond description in order to secure knowledge \nabout His Being, crossing the dark pitfalls of the unknown and \nconcentrating towards him, He would turn them back. They would return \ndefeated admitting that the reality of His knowledge cannot be \ncomprehended by such random efforts, nor can an iota of the sublimity of \nHis Honor enter the understanding of thinkers. \nAllah’s Creation: \n \nHe originated the creation without any example which He could \nfollow and without any specimen prepared by any known creator that was \nbefore Him. He showed us the realm of His Might and such wonders \nwhich speak of His Wisdom. The confession of the created things that \ntheir existence owes itself to Him made us realize that argument has been \nfurnished about knowing Him (so that there is no excuse against it). The \nsigns of His creative power and standard of His wisdom are fixed in the \nwonderful things He has created. Whatever He has created is an argument \nin His favor and a guide towards Him. Even a silent thing is a guide \ntowards Him as though it speaks and its guidance towards the Creator is \nclear.\n(O Allah!) I testify that he who likens You with the separateness \nof the limbs or with the joining of the extremities of his body did not \nacquaint his inner self with knowledge about You and his heart did not \nsecure conviction to the effect that there is no partner for You. It is as \nthough he has not heard the (wrongful) followers declaiming their false \ngods by saying, “By Allah! We are certainly in manifest error when we \nequaled you with the master of the worlds” (Holy Quran, 26: 97-98). \nThey are wrong who liken You to their idols and outfit You with apparel \nof the creatures by their imagination, attribute to You parts of body by \ntheir own thinking and consider You after the creatures of various types, \nthrough the working of their intelligence. I testify that whoever equated \nYou with anything out of Your creation took a match for You and \nwhoever takes a match for You is an unbeliever, according to what is \nstated in thy unambiguous verses and indicated by the testimony of Your \nclear arguments. (I also testify that) You are that Allah Who cannot be \nconfined in (the fetters of) intelligence so as to admit change of condition \nby entering its imagination nor in the shackles of mind so as to become \nlimited and an object of alterations. \nPart of the Same Sermon: \nAbout the Greatest Perfection in Allah’s Creation: \n \nHe has fixed limits for everything He has created and has made \nthe limits firm and He has fixed its working and has made the working \ndelicate. He has fixed its direction and it does not transgress the limits of \nits status nor fall short of reaching the end of its aim. It did not disobey \nwhen it was commanded to move at His will. How could it do so when all \nmatters are governed by His will. He is the Producer of a variety of things \nwithout exercise of imagination, without the urge of an impulse hidden in \nHim, without (the benefit of) any experiment taken from the vicissitudes \nof time and without any partner who might have assisted Him in creating \nwonderful things. \n \nThus, the creation was completed by His order and it bowed to \nHis obedience and responded to His call. The laziness of any slug or the \ninertness of any excuse-finder did not prevent it from doing so. So He \nstraightened the curves of the things and fixed their limits. With His \npower He created coherence in their contradictory parts and joined \ntogether the factors of similarity. Then He separated them in varieties \nwhich differ in limits, quantities, properties and shapes. All this is new \ncreation. He made them firm and shaped them according as He wished \nand invented them. \nPart of the same sermon: Description of the Sky: \n \nHe has arranged the depressions and elevations of the openings of \nthe sky. He has joined the breadths of its breaches and has joined them \nwith one another. He has made easy the approach to its heights for those \n(angels) who come down with His commands and those (angels) who go \nup with the deeds of the creatures. He called it when it was yet (in the \nform of) vapor. At once the links of its joints joined up. Then Allah \nopened up its closed door and put the sentinels of meteors at its holes and \nheld them with His hands (i.e. power) from falling into the vastness of air. \n \nHe commanded it to remain stationary in obedience to His \ncommands. He made its sun the bright indication for its day and its moon \nthe gloomy indication for its night. He then put them in motion in their \norbits and ordained their (pace of) movement in the stages of their paths \nin order to distinguish with their help between night and day and in order \nthat the reckoning of years and calculations may be known by their fixed \nmovements. Then He hung in its vastness its sky and put the rein its \ndecoration consisting of small bright pearls and lamp-like stars. He shot at \nthe over-hearers arrows of bright meteors. He put them in motion on their \nappointed routine and made them into fixed stars, moving stars, \ndescending stars, ascending stars, ominous stars and lucky stars. \nPart of the same sermon: \n \nDescribing the Angels:\n \nThen Allah, the Glorified One, created for inhabiting of His skies \nand populating the higher strata of his realm new (a variety of) creatures \nnamely the angels. With them He filled the openings of its cavities and \npopulated them with the vastness of its circumference. In between the \nopenings of these cavities there resounds the voices of angels glorifying \nHim in the enclosures of sublimity, (behind) curtains of concealment and \nin veils of His Greatness. And behind this resounding which deafens the \nears there is the glory of light which defies the approach of sight to it and \nconsequently the sight stands, disappointed at its limitation. \n \nHe created them in different shapes and with diverse \ncharacteristics. They have wings. They glorify the sublimity of His \nHonor. They do not appropriate to themselves His skill that shows itself \nin creation. Nor do they claim they create anything in which He is \nunparalleled. “But they are rather honored creatures who do not take \nprecedence over Him in uttering anything and they act according to His \ncommand” (Holy Quran, 21: 26-27). He has made them the trustees of \nHis revelation and sent them to prophets as holders of His injunctions and \nprohibitions. He has immunized them against the waviness of doubts. \nConsequently no one among them goes astray from the path of His will. \nHe has helped them with the benefits of succor and has covered their \nhearts with humility and peace. He has opened for them doors of \nSubmission to His Glories. He has fixed for them bright minarets as signs \nof His Oneness. The weights of sins do not burden them and the rotation \nof nights and days does not make them move. Doubts do not attack with \narrows the firmness of their faith. Misgivings do not assault the bases of \ntheir beliefs. The spark of malice does not ignite among them. \nAmazement does not tarnish what knowledge of Him their hearts possess, \nor His greatness and awe of His glory that resides in their bosoms. Evil \nthoughts do not lean towards them to affect their imagination with their \nown rust. \n \nAmong them are those who are in the frame of heavy clouds, or \nin the height of lofty mountains, or in the gloom of over-powering \ndarkness. And there are those whose feet have pierced the lowest \nboundaries of the earth. These feet are like white ensigns which have \ngone forth into the vast expanse of wind. Under them blows the light wind \nwhich retains them until its last end. \n \nOccupation in His worship has made them carefree and realities \nof Faith have served as a link between them and His knowledge. Their \nbelief in Him has made them concentrate on Him. They long for Him not \nfor others. They have tasted the sweetness of His knowledge and have \ndrunk from the satiating cup of His love. The roots of His fear have been \nimplanted in the depth of their hearts. Consequently they have bent their \nstraight backs through His worship. The length of the humility and \nextreme nearness has not removed from them the rope of their fear. \n \nThey do not entertain pride so as to make much of their acts. \nTheir humility before the glory of Allah does not allow them to esteem \ntheir own virtues. Languor does not affect them despite their long \naffliction. Their longings (for Him) do not lessen so that they might turn \naway from hope in (Allah) their Sustainer. The tips of their tongues do not \nget dry by constant prayers (to Allah). Engagements (in other matters) do \nnot betake them so as to turn their (loud) voices for Him into faint ones. \nTheir shoulders do not get displaced in the postures of worship. They do \nnot move their necks (this and that way) for comfort in disobedience of \nHis command. Follies of negligence do not act against their determination \nto strive and the deceptions of desires do not overcome their courage. \n \nThey regard the master of the Throne (Allah) as the store for the \nday of their need. Because of their love (for Him) they turn to Him even \nwhen others turn to the creatures. They do not reach the ending limit of \nHis worship. Their passionate fondness for His worship does not turn \nthem except to the springs of their own hearts, springs which are never \ndevoid of His hope and His fear. Fear of (Allah) never leaves them so that \nthey might slacken in their efforts, nor have temptations entrapped them \nso that they might prefer this light search over their (serious) effort. \n \nThey do not consider their past (virtuous) deeds as big, for if they \nhad considered them big then fear would have wiped away hopes from \ntheir hearts. They did not differ (among themselves) about their Sustainer \nas a result of Satan’s control over them. The vice of separation from one \nanother did not disperse them. Rancor and mutual malice did not \noverpower them. Ways of wavering did not divide them. Differences of \ndegree of courage did not render them into divisions. Thus they are \ndevotees of faith. Neither crookedness (of mind), nor excess, nor lethargy \nnor languor breaks them from its rope. There is not the thinnest point in \nthe skies but there is an angel over it in prostration (before Allah) or \n(busy) in quick performance (of His commands). By long worship of their \nSustainer they increase their knowledge and the honor of their Sustainer \nincreases in their hearts. \nPart of the Same Sermon: Description of the Earth and its \nExpansion over Water: \n \nAllah spread the earth on stormy and tumultuous waves and the \ndepths of swollen seas, where waves clashed with each other and high \nsurges leapt over one another. They emitted foam like the he-camel at the \ntime of sexual excitement. So the tumult of the stormy water was subdued \nby the weight of the earth, when the earth pressed it with its chest its \nshooting agitation eased and when the earth rolled on it with its shoulder \nbones the water meekly submitted. Thus, after tumult of its surges it \nbecame tame and overpowered and an obedient prisoner of the shackles \nof disgrace, while the earth spread itself and became solid in the stormy \ndepth of this water. (In this way) the earth put an end to the pride, self \nconceit, high status and superiority of the water and muzzled the \nintrepidity of its flow. Consequently, it stopped after its stormy flow, \nsettling down after its tumult. \nWhen the excitement of water subsided under the earth’s sides \nand under the weight of the high and lofty mountains placed on its \nshoulders, Allah flowed springs of water from its high tops and \ndistributed them through plains and low places and moderated their \nmovement by fixed rocks and high mountain tops. Then its trembling \ncame to a standstill because of the penetration of mountains in (various) \nparts of its surface and their being fixed in its deep areas and their \nstanding on its plains. Then Allah created the vastness between the earth \nand firmament and provided the blowing wind for its inhabitants. Then \nHe directed its inhabitants to spread all over its convenient places. \nThereafter He did not leave the barren tracts of the earth alone where high \nportions lacked in water-springs and where rivers could not find their \nway, but created floating clouds which enliven the unproductive areas and \ngrow vegetation. \n \nHe made a big cloud by collecting together small clouds and \nwhen water collected in it and lightning began to flash on its sides and the \nflash continued under the white clouds as well as the heavy ones He sent \nit heavily raining. The cloud was hanging towards the earth and southerly \nwinds were squeezing it into shedding its water like a she-camel bending \ndown for milking. When the cloud prostrated itself on the ground and \ndelivered all the water it carried on itself Allah grew vegetation on the \nplain earth and herbage on dry mountains. As a result, the earth felt \npleased at being decorated with its gardens and wondered at her outfit of \nsoft vegetation and the ornaments of its blossoms. Allah made all this the \nmeans of sustenance for the people and feed for the beasts. He has opened \nup highways in its expanse and has established minarets (of guidance) for \nthose who tread on its highways. \nOn the Creation of Man and the Sending of the Prophet (h):\n \nOnce He had spread out the earth and enforced His commands, \nHe chose Adam (x) as the best of His creation, making him the first \n[human being] to create. He made him to reside in Paradise and arranged \nfor his eating in it and also indicated from what He had prohibited him. \nHe told him that proceeding towards it meant His disobedience and \nendangering his own status. But Adam did what he had been refrained \nfrom, just as Allah already knew beforehand. Consequently, Allah sent \nhim down after (accepting) his repentance, to populate His earth with his \nprogeny and to serve as a proof and plea for Him among his creatures. \nEven when He made Adam die He did not leave them without \none who would serve among them as proof and plea for His Godhead and \nserve as the link between them and His knowledge. But He provided to \nthem the proofs through His chosen Messengers and bearers of the trust of \nHis Message, age after age till the process came to end with Prophet \nMuhammad (h) and His pleas and warnings reached finality. \n \nHe ordained livelihoods with plenty and with paucity. He \ndistributed them narrowly as well as profusely. He did it with justice to \ntest whomever He desired, with prosperity or with destitution and to test \nthrough it the gratefulness or endurance of the rich and the poor. Then He \ncoupled plenty with the misfortune of destitution, safety with the \ndistresses of calamities and pleasures of enjoyment with pangs of grief. \nHe created fixed ages and made them long or short and earlier or later, \nending them with death. He had made death capable of pulling up the \nropes of ages and cutting them asunder. He151 knows the secrets of those \n \n151The eloquence with which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has thrown on \nAllah’s attributes of knowledge and the sublime words in which he has pictured \nthe all-engrossing quality of His knowledge cannot but impress the mind of the \nmost die-hard opponent. Thus, Ibn Abul-Hadid has written: “If Aristotle, who \nbelieved that God is only aware of the universe and not of its particulars, had \nheard this speech, his heart, too, would have inclined, his hair would have stood \non end, and his thinking would have undergone a dramatic change.” Do you not \nsee the brightness, force, vehemence, sublimity, glory, seriousness and ripeness \nof this speech? Besides these qualities, there is sweetness, colorfulness, delicacy \nand smoothness in it. I have not found any utterance similar to it. Of course, if \nthere is any utterance matching it, that can be the word of Allah only. And there \nis no wonder in it because he is an offshoot of the same tree (of the Prophet (h)\nIbrahim who set up the Unity of Allah), a tributary of the same river and a \nreflection of the same light, as we read in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 7, pp. 23-\n24. \n \nThose who regard Allah to possess only overall knowledge argue that \nsince details undergo changes, to believe Him to have knowledge of the changing \ndetails would necessitate changes in His knowledge but since knowledge is the \nsame as His Being, His Being would have to be regarded as the object of change \nthe result of which would be that He would have to be taken as having come into \nexistence. In this way He would lose the attribute of being from ever. This is a \nvery deceptive fallacy because changes in the object of knowledge can lead to \nchanges in the One Who knows everything only when it is assumed that the One \nWho knows everything does not already possess knowledge of these changes. \nBut since all the forms of change and alteration are so strikingly obvious before \nHim there is no reason that with the changes in the objects of knowledge that He \ntoo should be regarded as changeable, although really this change is confined to \nthe object of knowledge and does not affect knowing in itself. \nwho conceal them, the secret conversation of those who engage in it, the \ninner feelings of those who indulge in guesses, the established certainties, \nthe inklings of the eyes, the inner contents of hearts and the depths of the \nunknown. He also knows what can be heard only by bending the holes of \nthe ears, the summer resorts of ants and winter abodes of the insects, \nresounding of the cries of wailing women and the sound of steps. He also \nknows the spots in the inner sheaths of leaves where fruits grow, the \nhiding places of beasts namely caves in mountains and valleys, the hiding \nholes of mosquitoes on the trunks of trees and their herbage, the sprouting \npoints of leaves in the branches, the dripping points of semen passing \nthrough passages of loins, small rising clouds and the big giant ones, the \ndrops of rain in the thick clouds, the particles of dust scattered by \nwhirlwinds through their skirts, the lines erased by rain floods, the \nmovements of insects on sand-dunes, the nests of winged creatures on the \ncliffs of mountains and the singing of chattering birds in the gloom of \ntheir brooding places. \n \nAnd He knows whatever has been treasured by the mother-of-\npearls and covered under ocean waves, all that which is concealed under \nthe darkness of night and all that on which the light of day is shining, as \nwell as all that on which sometimes darkness prevails and sometimes light \nshines, the trace of every footstep, the feel of every movement, the echo \nfor every sound, the motion of every lip, the abode of every living being, \nthe weight of every particle, the sobs of every sobbing heart and whatever \nis on the earth like fruits of trees or falling leaf, or settling place of semen, \nor the congealing of blood or clot and the developing of life and embryo. \n \nOn all this, He suffers no trouble and no impediment hampers \nHim in the preservation of what he created nor any languor or grief \nhinders Him from the enforcement of commands and management of the \ncreatures, His knowledge penetrates through them and they are within His \ncounting. His justice extends to all of them and His bounty encompasses \nthem despite their falling short of what is due to Him. \n \nO Lord! You deserve handsome description and the highest \nesteem. If wish is directed towards You, You are the best to be wished \nfor. If hope is reposed in You, You are the most Honored to be hoped for. \nO Lord! You hast bestowed on me such power that I do not praise any \none other than You and I do not eulogize any one save You. I do not \ndirect my praise towards others who are sources of disappointment and \ncenters of misgivings. You hast kept away my tongue from the praises of \nhuman beings and eulogies of the created and the sustained. O Lord! \nEvery who praises has on whom he praises the right of reward and \nrecompense. Certainly, I have turned to You with my eye at the treasures \nof Your Mercy and stores of forgiveness. \n \nO Lord! here stands one who has singled You with Oneness that \nis Your due and has not regarded any one deserving of these praises and \neulogies except You. My want towards You is such that nothing except \nYour generosity can cure its destitution, nor provide for its need except \nYour obligation and Your generosity. So do grant us in this place Your \nwill and make us free from stretching hands to anyone other than You. \n“Certainly, You are powerful over everything” (Holy Quran, 66: 8). \n \nAllah is the Guarantor of sustenance and Provider of livelihood as \nHe says the following: \n \nNo creature is there crawling on the earth, but its provision \n \nrests on Allah. (Holy Quran, 11: 6) \n \nBut His being guarantor means that He has provided ways for \neveryone to live and earn livelihood and has allowed everyone equal \nshares in forests, mountains, rivers, mines and in the vast earth and has \ngiven everyone the right to make use of them. His bounties are not \nconfined to any single person, nor is the door of His sustenance closed to \nany one. Thus, Allah says the following: \nWe do aid everyone: These and (also) those, out of the bounty of \nyour Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not confined. (Holy Quran, 17: \n20)\n \nIf someone does not secure these things through languor or ease \nand sits effortless, it is not possible that livelihood would reach his door. \nAllah has laid the table with multifarious feeds but to get them it is \nnecessary to extend the hand. He has deposited pearls in the bottom of the \nsea but it requires diving to get them out. He has filled the mountains with \nrubies and precious stones but they cannot be had without digging the \nstones. The earth contains treasures of growth but benefit cannot be drawn \nfrom them without sowing of seed. Heaps of edibles lie scattered on all \nfour sides of the earth but they cannot be collected without the trouble of \ntravelling. Thus, Allah says the following:\nTraverse, then, its (earth’s) broad sides and eat of His \nprovision.(Holy Quran, 67: 15) \nAllah providing livelihood does not mean that no effort is needed \nin searching livelihood, or no going out of the house is required, for it and \nthat livelihood should itself finds its way to the seeker. The meaning of \nHis being the provider of livelihood is that He has given earth the \nproperty of growing. He has sent rain from clouds for germination, \ncreated fruits, vegetables and grains. All this is from Allah but securing \nthem is connected with human effort. Whoever will strive will reap the \nbenefits of his efforts and whoever abstains from strife would face the \nconsequences of his idleness and laziness. Accordingly Allah says the \nfollowing:\nAnd that man shall have nothing but what he strives for. (Holy \nQuran, 53: 39) \n \nThe order of universe hinges on the maxim “You reap what you \nsow”. It is wrong to expect germination without sowing, to hope for \nresults without effort. Limbs and faculties have been given solely to be \nkept active. Thus, Allah addressed Mary and says the following: \nAnd shake towards you the trunk of the palm-tree, it will \ndrop on you dates fresh (and) ripe. Then eat and drink and refresh \nthe eye. (Holy Quran, 19: 25-26) \n \nAllah provided the means for Mary’s sustenance. He did not \nhowever pluck the dates from the tree and put them in her la, p. This was \nbecause so far as production of food goes it is His concern. So he made \nthe tree green, put fruits on it and ripened the fruits. But when the stage \narrived for plucking them He did not intervene. He just recalled to Mary \nher job namely that she should now move her hand and get her food. \n \nAgain, if His providing the livelihood means that whatever is \ngiven is given by Him and whatever is received from Him, then whatever \na man would earn and eat and in whatever manner he would obtain it \nwould be permissible for him, whether he obtains it by the ft, bribery, \noppression or violence. It would mean Allah’s act and the food would be \nthat given by Him, wherein he would have no free will and where \nanything is out of the limits of free action there is no question of \npermissible or forbidden for it, nor is there any liability to account for it. \nBut when it is not actually so and there is the question of permissible and \nforbidden then it should give bearing on human actions, so that it could be \nquestioned whether it was secured in lawful or unlawful actions and \nmanners. Of course, where He has not bestowed the power of seeking the \nlivelihood, there He has taken upon Himself the responsibility to provide \nthe livelihood. Consequently He has managed for the feeding of the \nembryo in the mother’s womb and it reaches him there according to its \nneeds and requirements. But when this very young life enters the wide \nworld and picks up energy to move its limbs, then it can not get its food \nfrom the source without moving his lips (for sucking the milk). \n \nIn the management of the affairs of this world, Allah has \nconnected the sequence with the cause of human acts as a result of which \nthe power of action in man does not remain idle. In the same way He had \nmade these actions dependent on His own will, so man should not rely on \nhis own power of action and forget the Creator. This is the issue of the \nwill between two wills in the controversy of “free will” versus \n“compulsion”. Just as in the entire universe, nature’s universal and \nsovereign law is in force, in the same way the production and distribution \nof food also is provided in a set manner under the dual force of the Divine \nordainment of human effort. And this is somewhere less and somewhere \nmore depending on the proportion of human effort and the aim of the \nDivine ordainment. Since He is the Creator of the means of livelihood and \nthe powers of seeking food have also been bestowed by Him, the paucity \nor plenty of livelihood has been attributed to Him because He has fixed \ndifferent and separate measures for livelihood keeping in view the \ndifference in efforts and actions and the good of the creatures. Somewhere \nthere is poverty and somewhere affluence, somewhere distress and \nsomewhere comfort and some one is enjoying pleasure while some one \nelse is suffering the hardships of want. \nThe Holy Quran says the following: \nHe amplifies the sustenance of whomsoever He pleases and \nstraitens; Verily, He knows all things.

    "text": ", Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) refers to this matter \nthus: “The Divine command descends from the sky towards the earth with \nwhatever is ordained for everyone, whether less or more, just like rain \ndrops.\n \nSo, there is a fixed process and manner for the benevolence of \nrain namely that vapors rise from the sea with the store of water, spread \nover in the sky in the shape of dark clouds then ooze the water by drops \ntill they form themselves in regular lines. They irrigate plains as well as \nhigh lands thoroughly and proceed onwards to collect in the low areas, so \nthat the thirsty may drink it, animals may use it and dry lands may be \nwatered from it. In the same way Allah has provided all the means of \nlivelihood but His bounty follows a particular mode in which there is \nnever a jot of deviation. Thus, Allah says the following: \nAnd there is not a thing but with Us are its treasures and We do \nnot send it down but in a known measure. (Holy Quran, 15: 21) \n \nIf man’s greed and avarice exceeds its bounds, then just as an \nexcess of rain ruins crops instead of growing and bringing them up, so the \nabundance of the articles of livelihood and the necessities of life would \nmake man obvious of Allah and rouse him to rebellion and unruliness. \nConsequently, Allah says the following: \nAnd should Allah amplify the sustenance unto his servants, they \nwould certainly rebel in the earth, but He sends it down by measure as \nHe pleases; Verily of His servants, He is All-aware, All-seeing. (Holy \nQuran, 42: 27) \n \nIf He lessens the food then just as a drought makes the land arid \nand kills the animals, likewise, by closure of the means of livelihood, the \nhuman society would be destroyed and so there would remain no means \nof living and livelihood. Allah accordingly says the following: \nOr who is that who can provide you with sustenance should He \nwithhold His sustenance?(Holy Quran, 67: 21) \n \nConsequently, Allah, the Wise, the Omniscient, has put the \norganization for livelihood on moderate and proportionate lines and in \norder to emphasize the importance of livelihood and sustenance and to \nkeep them correlated with each other has introduced differences in the \ndistribution of livelihood. Sometimes, this difference and unequal \ndistribution owes itself to the difference of human effort and sometimes it \nis the consequence of overall arrangement of the affairs of the Universe \nand the Divine acts of wisdom and objectives. This is so because, if by \npoverty and want He has tested the poor in endurance and patience, in \naffluence and wealth there is severe test of the rich by way of \nthanksgiving and gratifying the rights of others, namely whether the rich \nperson gratifies the claims of the poor and the distressed and whether he \ntakes care of the destitute or not. Again, where there is wealth there would \nalso be dangers of all sorts. Sometimes there would be danger to the \nwealth and property and sometimes fear of poverty and want. \n \nConsequently, there would be many persons who would be more \nsatisfied and happy for lack of wealth. For them this destitution and want \nwould be far better than the wealth which might snatch away their \ncomfort and peace. Moreover sometimes this very wealth which one \nholds dearer than life becomes the cause of loss of one’s life. Further, it \nhas also been seen that for as long as wealth was lacking character was \nabove reproach, life was unblemished, but the moment property and \nwealth changed into plenty the conduct worsened, character became \nfaulty and there appeared the vices of Awine, women and wealth. In such \ncases the absence of wealth was a blessing. However being ignorant of \nAllah’s objectives man cries out and being affected by transitory distress \nbegins complaining but does not realize from how many vices which \ncould have accrued owing to wealth he has remained aloof. Therefore, if \nwealth produces conveniences, poverty serves as a guard for the \ncharacter."

    "text": "When People Decided to Swear Allegiance to Imam Ali Ibn \nAbu Talib’s Hand after the Murder of Othman, He Said the \nFollowing:\n \nLeave me and seek someone else. We are facing a matter which \nhas (several) faces and colors, which neither hearts can stand nor \nintelligence can accept. Clouds are hovering over the sky and faces are \nnot discernable. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead \nyou as I know and would not care about whatever one may say or abuse. \nIf you leave me then I am the same as you are. It is possible I would listen \nto and obey whomever you make in charge of your affairs. I am better for \nyou as a counselor than as chief. \n \nWith the murder of Othman, the caliphate became vacant and \nMuslims began to look at Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) whose peaceful \nconduct, adherence to principles and political acumen had been witnessed \nby them to a great extent during this long period. Consequently they \nrushed to swear allegiance on his righteousness in much the same way a \ntraveler who had lost his way, then finding it again rushes towards his \ndestination, as the historian al-Tabari (in Tarikh, Vol. 1, pp. 3066, 3067, \n3076) records the following: “People thronged around Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) and said, “We want to swear the oath of allegiance to you; you \ncan see what troubles have befallen Islam and how we are being tried \nwith regard to the near in kin of the Prophet (h).”\nBut Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) declined to accede to their \nrequest whereupon these people raised hue and cry and began to shout \nloudly, “O Abul-Hassan! Do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see \nthe advancing flood of unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of \nAllah?!” Even Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) showed no readiness to \nconsent because he was noticing that the effects of the atmosphere that \nhad come into being after the Prophet (h) had overcome hearts and \nminds of the people. Selfishness and lust for power had become rooted in \nthem, their thinking had become affected by materialism and they had \nbecome habituated to treating government as the means for securing their \nends. Now they would like to materialize the Divine Caliphate too and \nplay with it. In these circumstances it would be impossible to change the \nmentalities or turn their direction of temperaments. In addition to these \nideas he had also seen the end in sight, that these people should have \nfurther time to think on it so that on frustration of their material ends \nhereafter they should not say that the allegiance had been sworn by them \nunder a temporary expediency and timely thought and that nature \n(rational) thought had not been given to it, just as `Omer’s idea was about \nthe first caliphate, which appears from his statement that: “bu Bakr’s \ncaliphate came into being without due thought, but Allah saved us from \nits mischief. If anyone repeats such an affair, you should kill him, as \nstated in \\sect fs22 Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, pp.210, 211; in Al-Musnad \nof Imam Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, p.55; in al-Tabari, Vol. 1, p.1822; in \nIbn al-Athir, Vol. 2, p.327; in Ibn Hisham, Vol. 4, pp.308-309, and in Ibn \nKathir, Vol. 5, p.246. \n \nIn short, when their insistence increased beyond limits, Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon wherein he clarified that: If you \nwant me for your worldly ends, then I am not ready to serve as your \ninstrument. Leave me and select someone else who may fulfil your ends. \nYou have seen my past life that I am not prepared to follow anything \nexcept the Holy Quran and Sunnah and would not give up this principle \nfor securing power. If you select someone else I would pay regard to the \nlaws of the state and the constitution as a peaceful citizen should do. I \nhave not at any stage tried to disrupt the collective existence of the \nMuslims by inciting rebellion. The same will happen now. Rather, just as \nkeeping the common good in view I have hitherto been giving correct \nadvice, I will not grudge doing the same. If you put me in the same status, \nit will be better for your worldly ends because in that case I will not have \npower in my hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs \nand create impediment against your heart’s wishes. However, if you are \ndetermined to swear the oath of allegiance to me, then bear in mind that if \nyou frown or speak against me, I will force you to tread on the path of \nright and in the matter of the right I will not care for anyone. If you want \nto swear the oath of allegiance even at this, you can satisfy your wish.” \n \nThe impression Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had formed about \nthose people is fully corroborated by later events. Consequently, when \nthose who had sworn allegiance with worldly motives did not succeed in \ntheir objectives they broke away and rose against his government with \nbaseless allegations."

    "text": "About the Annihilation of the Kharijites, Themischief \nMongering of Umayyads and the Vastness of His Knowledge: \n \nSo now, Praise and Glorification belong to Allah. O people! I \nhave put out the eye of rebellion. No one except me advanced towards it \nwhen its gloom was swelling and its madness was intense. Ask me before \n \n152Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon after the battle of \nNahrawan. In it, “mischiefs” implicitly refers to the battles fought in Basra, Siffin \nand Nahrawan because their nature was different from the battles of the Prophet \n(h). There the opposite party was the unbelievers while here the confrontation \nwas with those who had veils of Islam on their faces. So people were hesitant to \nfight against Muslims and said why they should fight with those who recited the \ncall to the prayers and offered the prayers. Thus, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-\nAnsari did not take part in the Battle of Siffin till the falling of Ammar ibn Yasir \nas martyr did not prove the opposite party was rebellious. Similarly the presence \nof companions like Talhah and az-Zubayr who were included in the Foretold Ten \non the side of Aisha in Basra and the prayer signs on foreheads of the Kharijites \nin Nahrawan and their prayers and worships were creating confusion in the \nminds. In these circumstances only those could have the courage to rise against \nthem were aware of the secrets of their hearts and the reality of their faith. It was \nthe peculiar perception of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and his spiritual courage \nthat he rose to oppose them and testified to the saying of the Holy Prophet (h):\n“You will fight after me with the breakers of allegiance (people of Jamal), \noppressors (people of Syria) and deviators (the Kharijites) as we read in the \nfollowing references: “Al-Mustadrak Ala as-Sahihayn, al-Hakim, Vol. 3, pp.139-\n40; Al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol6, p.18; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p.1117; Usd al-Ghaba,\nVol. 4 pp.32, 33; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 8, p.340; Vol. 13, p. 186, 187; Tarikh, \nIbn Asakir, Vol. 5, p. 41; Tarikh Ibn Kathar, Vol. 7, pp. 304-6; Majma` az-\nZawa’id, Vol. 7, p. 238; Vol. 9, p. 235; Sharh al-Mawahib, Vol. 3, pp. 316-317; \nKanz al-Ummal, Vol. 6, pp.72,82,88,155,319,391,392; Vol. 8, p.215. \nyou miss me,153 because, by Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you \nask me anything between now and the Day of Judgement or about the \ngroup who will guide a hundred people and also misguide a hundred \npeople, I will tell you who is announcing its march, who is driving it in \nthe front and who is driving it at the rear, the stages where its riding \nanimals will stop for rest and the final place of stay and who among them \nwill be killed and who will die a natural death. \n \nWhen I am dead hard circumstances and distressing events will \nbefall you. Many persons in the status of asking questions will remain \nsilent with eyes cast down while those in the status of replying will lose \ncourage. This will be at a time when wars will descend upon you with all \nhardship and days will be so hard on you that you will feel them \nprolonged because of hardship till Allah will give victory to those \nremaining virtuous among you. \n \n153After the Holy Prophet (h) no one except Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) could \nutter the challenge. Ask whatever you want to. ibn Abdul-Barr in Jami Bayan al-\nIlm wa fadlihi, Vol. 1, p.58 and in Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p.1103; Ibn al-Athi \nr in Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 4, p.22; Ibn Abul-Hadid in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol7, \np. 46; as-Sayyuti in Tarikh al-Khulafa’, p.171 and ibn Hajar al-Haytami in Al-\nSawa’iq al-Muhriqa, p.76 have written that “None among the companions of the \nHoly Prophet (h) ever said, ‘Ask me whatever you want’ except Ali ibn Abu \nTalib.” However, among other than the companions a few names do appear in \nhistory who did utter such a challenge, such as Ibrahim ibn Hisham al-\nMakhzumi, Muqatil ibn Sulayman, Qaradah ibn Di’amah, Abd ar-Rahman (Ibn \nal-Jawzi) and Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi’i etc. but everyone of them faced \ndisgrace and was forced to take back his challenge. This challenge can be urged \nonly by him who knew the realities of the universe and is aware of the \nhappenings of the future. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) the opener of the door of \nthe Prophet’s knowledge as he was, was the only person who was never seen \nbeing unable to answer any question on any occasion. This was so much so that \neven `Umar had to say that AI seek Allah’s protection from the difficulty for the \nsolution of which Ali will not be available. Similarly, the prophesies of Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) made about the future proved true word-for-word and served as \nan index to his vast knowledge, whether they be about the devastation of Banu \nUmayyah, of the risings of the Kharijites, the wars and destruction by the Tatars, \nof the attacks of the English, the floods of Basra and the ruination of Kufa. In \nshort when these events are historical realities there is no reason why this \nchallenge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) should be wondered at. \nWhen mischief comes they confuse (right with wrong) and when \nthey clear away they leave a warning. They cannot be known at the time \nof approach but are recognized at the time of return. They blow like the \nblowing of winds, striking some cities and missing others. \n \nBeware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief \nof Banu Umayyah because it is blind and also creates darkness. Its sway \nis general but its ill effects are for particular people. He who remains \nclear-sighted in it will be affected by distress and he who remains blind in \nit will avoid the distress. By Allah, after me you will find Banu \nUmmayyah the very worst for yourselves, like the old unruly she-camel \nwho bites with its mouth, beats with its fore-legs, kicks with its hind legs \nand refuses to be milked. They will remain over you till they will leave \namong you only those who benefit them or those who do not harm them. \nTheir calamity will continue till your seeking help from them will become \nlike the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the follower \nfrom the leader. \n \nTheir mischief will come to you like evil-eyed fear and pre-\nIslamic fragments, wherein there will be no minaret of guidance nor any \nsign (of salvation) to be seen. We Ahl al-Bayt (x) (the Household of the \nProphet (h)) are free from this mischief and we are not among those who \nwill engender it. Thereafter, Allah will dispel it from you like the removal \nof the skin (from flesh) through him who will humble them, drag them by \ntheir necks, make them drink full cups (of hardships), not extend to them \nanything but sword and not clothe them except with fear. At that time \nQuraish will wish at the cost of the world and all its contents to find me \neven only once and just for the duration of the slaughter of a camel in \norder that I may accept from them (the whole of) that of which at present. \nI am asking them only a part but they are not giving me."

Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes their \ncheeks. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though \nthey stood on live coals. It seemed that in between their eyes there were \nsigns like knees of goats, resulting from long prostrations. When Allah \nwas mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were \ndrenched. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as \nthe tree trembles on the day of stormy wind."

His \nknowledge has split forth the inside of unknown secrets and covered the \nbottom of deep beliefs. \nPart of the same sermon about the Holy Prophet (h):\n \nAllah chose him from the lineal tree of prophets, from the flame \nof light, from the forehead of greatness, from the best part of the valley of \nal-Bat’ha’, from the lamps for darkness and from the sources of wisdom. \nPart of the same sermon:\n \nThe Prophet (h) was like a roaming physician who has readied \nhis ointments and heated his instruments. He uses them wherever the need \narises for curing blind hearts, deaf ears and dumb tongues. He followed \nwith his medicines the spots of negligence and places of perplexity. \nRemonstrating with the Muslims: \n \nThey (people) did not take light from the lights of his wisdom nor \ndid they produce flame from the flint of sparkling knowledge. So in this \nmatter they are like grazing cattle and hard stones. Nevertheless hidden \nthings have appeared for those who perceive. The face of right has \nbecome clear for the wanderer, the approaching moment has raised the \nveil from its face and signs have appeared for those who search for them. \n \nWhat is the matter with me! I see that you are just bodies without \nspirits and spirits without bodies, devotees without good, traders without \nprofits, wakeful but sleeping, present but unseen, seeing but blind, hearing \nbut deaf and speaking but dumb. \n \nI notice that misguidance has stood on its center and spread (all \naround) through its off-shoots. It weighs you with its weights and \nconfuses you with its measures. Its leader is an out-cast from the \ncommunity. He persists on misguidance. So on that day none from among \nyou will remain except as the sediment in a cooking pot or the dust left \nafter dusting a bundle. It will scrape you as leather is scraped and trample \nyou as harvest is trampled and pick out the believer as a bird picks out a \nbig grain from the thin grain. \n \nWhere are these ways taking you, gloom misleading you and \nfalsehoods deceiving you? Whence are you brought and where are you \ndriven? For every period there is a written document and everyone who is \nabsent has to return. So listen to your godly leader and keep your hearts \npresent. If he speaks to you be wakeful. The forerunner must speak truth \nto his people, should keep his wits together and maintain presence of \nmind. He has clarified to you the matter as the stitch hole is cleared and \nscraped it as the gum is scraped (from the twigs). \n \nNevertheless, now the wrong has set itself on its places and \nignorance has ridden on its riding beasts. Unruliness has increased while \nthe call for virtue is suppressed. Wrong has pounced in time like a \ndevouring carnivore and shouts like a camel after remaining silent. People \nhave become brothers over ill-doings, have forsaken the essential unity of \nthe religion but have instead, united in speaking lies and bear mutual \nhatreds in the matter of truth. \n \nWhen such is the case, the son will be a source of anger (instead \nof coolness of the eye to parents) and rain the cause of heat, the wicked \nwill abound and the virtuous will diminish. The people of this time will be \nwolves, its rulers beasts, the middle class men gluttons and the poor \n(almost) dead.

The eyes have not seen You, so as to be aware of You, \nbut You were before the describers of Your creation. You did not create \nthe creation on account of loneliness, nor did You make them work for \ngain. He whom You catches cannot go farther than You and he whom \nYou holds cannot escape You. He who disobeys You does not decrease \nYour authority and he who obeys You does not add to Your Might. He \nwho disagrees with Your judgement cannot turn it and he who turns away \nfrom Your command cannot do without You. Every secret before You is \nopen and for You every absent is present. \n \nYou are everlasting, there is no end to You. You are the highest \naim, there is no escape from You, You are the promised (point of return) \nfrom which there is no deliverance except towards You. In Your hand is \nthe forelock of every creature and to You is the return of every living \nbeing. Glory to You! How great is Your creation that we see, but how \nsmall is this greatness by the side of Your Might. How awe-striking is \nYour realm that we notice, but how humble is this against what is hidden \nfrom us out of Your authority. How extensive are Your bounties in this \nworld, but how small are they against the bounties of the next world. \nPart of the Same Sermon about the Angels: \n \nYou (O Allah) made angels reside in Your skies and placed them \nhigh above from Your earth. They have the most knowledge about You \nand Your whole creation, the most fearing from You and the nearest to \nYou. They never stayed in loins nor were retained in wombs. They were \nnot created Afrom mean water (semen) (Holy Quran, 32: 8; 77: 20). They \nwere not dispersed by vicissitudes of time. They are on their places \n(distinct) from You and in their positions near You. Their desires are \nconcentrated in You. Their worship for You is much. Their neglect from \nYour command is little. If they witness what remains hidden about You \nthey will regard their deeds as very little, they will criticize themselves \nand will realize that they did not worship You according to Your right for \nbeing worshipped and did not obey You as You has the right for being \nobeyed. \nAbout the Bounties and Guidance of Allah and Those Who \nAre Ungrateful:\n \nGlorified are You, O Creator, the One worshipped by all, on \naccount of Your good trials of Your creatures. You created a house (the \nParadise) and provided in it for feasting, drinks, foods, spouses, servants, \nplaces, streams, plantations and fruits. Then You sent a messenger to \ninvite towards it. But the people did not respond to the caller and did not \nfeel persuaded to what You persuaded them nor showed eagerness \ntowards what You desired them to eagerly feel. They jumped on the \ncarcass (of this world), earned shame by eating it and became united in \nloving it. \n \nWhen one loves a thing it blinds him and sickens his heart. Then \nhe sees but with a diseased eye, hears but with unhearing ears. Desires \nhave cut asunder his wit and the world has made his heart dead, while his \nmind is all longing for it. Consequently, he is a slave of it and of everyone \nwho has any share in it. Wherever it turns, he turns towards it and \nwherever it proceeds, he proceeds towards it. He is not desisted by any \ndisaster from Allah, nor takes admonition from any preacher. He sees \nthose who have been caught in neglect whence there is neither rescission \nnor reversion (repentance). \nAbout Death: \n \nWhatever they were ignoring has befallen them, separation from \nthis world, from which they took themselves safe, has come to them and \nthey have reached that in the Hereafter which they had been promised. \nWhatever has befallen them cannot be described. Pangs of death and grief \nfor losing (this world) have surrounded them. Consequently their limbs \nbecome languid and their complexion changes. Then death increases its \nstruggle over them. \n \nIn some it stands in between him and his power of speaking \nalthough he lies among his people, looking with eyes, hearing with his \nears, with full wits and intelligence. He then thinks over how he wasted \nhis life and in what (activities) he passed his time. He recalls the wealth \nhe collected when he had blinded himself in seeking it and acquired it \nfrom fair and foul sources. Now the consequences of collecting it have \novertaken him. He gets ready to leave it. It will remain for those who are \nbehind him. They will enjoy it and benefit by it. \n \nIt will be an easy acquisition for others but a burden on his back \nand the man cannot get rid of it. He will thereupon, bite his hands with his \nteeth out of shame for what was disclosed to him about his affairs at the \ntime of his death. He will dislike what he coveted during the days of his \nlife and he will wish that he who envied him on account of it and felt \njealous over him for it should have amassed it instead of he himself. \n \nDeath will go on affecting his body till his ears too will behave \nlike his tongue (and lose functioning). So he will lie among his people, \nneither speaking with his tongue or hearing with his ears. He will be \nrotating his glance over their faces, watching the movements of their \ntongues, but not hearing their speaking. Then death will increase its sway \nover him and his sight will be taken by death as the ears had been taken \nand the spirit will depart from his body. He will then become a carcass \namong his own people. They will feel loneliness from him and get away \nfrom him. He will not join a mourner or respond to a caller. Then they \nwill carry him to a small place in the ground and deliver him in it to (face) \nhis deeds. They will abandon visiting him. \nAbout the Day of Judgement: \n \nUntil whatever is written as ordained approaches its and the \naffairs complete their destined limits, the posteriors join the anteriors and \nwhatever Allah wills takes place in the shape of resurrection of His \ncreation. Then He will convulse the sky and split it. He will quake the \nearth and shake it. He will root out the mountains and scatter them. They \nwill crush each other out of awe of His Glory and fear of His Dignity. \n \nHe will take out everyone who is in it. He will refresh them after \nthey had been worn out and collect them after they had been separated. \nThen He will set them apart for questioning about the hidden deeds and \nsecret acts. He will then divide them into two groups, rewarding one and \npunishing the other. As regarding the obedient people He will reward \nthem with His nearness and will keep them forever in His house from \nwhere those who settle the rein do not move out. Their status will not \nundergo change, fear will not overtake them, ailments will not befall \nthem, dangers will not affect them and journey will not force them (from \nplace to place). \nAs for people of sins, He will settle them in the worst place, will \nbind their hands with the necks, bind the forelocks with feet and will \nclothe them in shirts of tar and dresses cut out of flames. They will be in \npunishment whose heat will be severe, the door will be closed on the \ninmates - in fire which is full of shouts and cries and rising flames and \nfearful voices. Its inmate does not move out of it, its prisoner cannot be \nreleased by ransom and its shackles cannot be cut. There is no fixed age \nfor this house so that it might perish, nor period for its life that might pass \naway. \nPart of the Same Sermon about the Holy Prophet (h):\nHe treated this world disdainfully and regarded it low. He held it \ncontemptible and hated it. He realized that Allah kept it away from him \nwith intention and spread it out for others by way of contempt. Therefore, \nhe remained away from it by his heart, banished its recollection from his \nmind and wished that its attraction should remain hidden from his eye so \nthat he should not acquire any clothing from it, or hope for staying in it. \nHe conveyed from Allah the pleas (against committing sins), counseled \nhis people as a warner (against the Divine chastisement) and he called \n(people) towards Paradise as a conveyor of good tidings. \nAbout the Descendants of the Holy Prophet (h):\nWe are the tree of Prophethood, staying place of (the Divine) Message, \ndescending place of angels, mines of knowledge and the sources of \nwisdom. Our supporter and lover awaits mercy while our enemy and he \nwho hates us awaits wrath."

    "text": "About Islam : \n \nThe best means by which seekers of nearness to Allah, the \nGlorified One, the Exalted, seek nearness, is the belief in Him and His \nProphet (h), fighting in His cause, for it is the high pinnacle of Islam and \n(to believe) in kalimatul-ikhlas (the expression of the Divine purification). \nIt is a just nature and the establishment of prayer for it is (the basis of) \ncommunity. The payment of zakat for it is a compulsory obligation, \nfasting for the month of Ramadan for it is the shield against chastisement. \nThe performance of hajj to the House of Allah (i.e. The Ka`ba) and its \n`umrah (other than annual visit) for these two acts banish poverty and \nwash away sins. Regard for kinship for it increases wealth and length of \nlife. Giving alms secretly for it covers shortcomings, giving alms openly \nfor it protects against a bad death and extending benefits (to people) for it \nsaves from positions of disgrace. \nAbout the Holy Quran and the Sunnah: \n \nGo ahead with the remembrance of Allah for it is the best \nremembrance and long for that which He has promised to the pious, for \nHis promise is the most true promise. Tread the course of the Prophet (h)\nfor it is the most distinguished course. Follow the Sunnah of the Prophet \n(h) for it is the most right of all behaviors. Learn the Holy Quran for it is \nthe fairest of discourses and understand it thoroughly for it is the best \nblossoming of hearts. Seek cure with its light for it is the cure for hearts. \nRecite it beautifully for it is the most beautiful narration. Certainly, a \nscholar who acts not according to his knowledge is like the off-headed \nignorant who does not find relief from his ignorance; but on the learned \nthe plea of Allah is greater and grief more incumbent and he is more \nblameworthy before Allah."

It \nexcites wonder with small things, is ornamented with (false) hopes and \ndecorated with deception. Its rejoicing does not last and its afflictions \ncannot be avoided. It is deceitful, harmful, changing, perishable, \nexhaustible, liable to destruction, gnawing and destructive. When it \nreaches the extremity of desires of those who incline towards it and feel \nhappy with it, the status is just what Allah, the most Glorified One, says \n(in the Holy Quran): \n... like water which We send down from the heavens and the \nherbage of the earth mingles with it, then it becomes dry stubble which \nthe winds scatter; for Allah over all things has power. (Holy Quran, 18: \n45)\n \nNobody rejoices about this world except that tears come to him \nafter it, and no one enjoys its comforts except that he has to face \nhardships in thereafter. No one receives the light rain of ease in it but the \nheavy rain of distress pours upon him. It is worthy of this world that in the \nmorning it supports a man but in the evening it does not recognize him. If \none side of it is sweet and pleasant the other side is bitter and distressing. \n \nNo one secures enjoyment from its freshness but he has to face \nhardship from its calamities. No one will pass the evening under the wing \nof safety but that his morning will be under the feathers of the wing-tip of \nfear. It is deceitful and all that is the rein is deception. It is perishable and \nall that is on it is to perish. There is no good in its provisions except in \npiety. Whoever takes little from it collects much of what will give him \nsafety, while one who takes much from it takes much of what will ruin \nhim. He will shortly depart from his collection. How many people relied \non it but it distressed them; (how many) felt peaceful with it but it made \nthem tumble; how many were prestigious but it made them low and how \nmany were proud but it made them disgraceful. \n \nIts authority is changing. Its life is dirty. Its sweet water is bitter. \nIts sweetness is like myrrh. Its food are poisons. Its means are weak. The \nliving in it are exposed to death; the healthy in it are exposed to disease. \nIts realm is (liable to be) snatched away. The strong in it are (liable to be) \ndefeated and the rich are (liable to be) afflicted with misfortune. The \nneighbor in it is (liable to be) plundered. \n \nAre you not (residing) in the houses of those before you, who \nwere of longer ages, better traces, had bigger desires, were more in \nnumbers and had greater armies? How they devoted themselves to the \nworld and how they showed preference to it! then they left it without any \nprovision that could convey them through, or the back (of a beast for \nriding) to carry them. \n \nDid you get the news that the world was ever generous enough to \npresent ransom for them, or gave them any support or afforded them good \ncompany? It rather inflicted them with troubles, made them languid with \ncalamities, assaulted them with catastrophes, threw them down on their \nnoses, trampled them under hoofs and helped the vicissitudes of time \nagainst them. You have observed its strangeness towards those who went \nnear it, acquired it and appropriated it, till they departed from it for good. \nDid it give them any provision other than starvation, or make them stay in \nother than narrow places, or give them light other than gloom, or give \nthem in the end anything other than repentance? Is this what you ask for \nso much or remain satisfied with, or towards which you feel greedy? How \nbad is this abode for him that he did not suspect it (to be so) and did not \nentertain fear from it? \nYou should know, as you do know, that you have to leave it and \ndepart from it. While in it, take lesson from those Awho proclaimed “who \nis more powerful than us?’ (Holy Quran, 41: 15), but they were carried to \ntheir graves, though not as riders. They were then made to stay in the \ngraves, but not as guests. Graves were made for them from the surface of \nthe ground. Their shrouds were made from earth. Old bones were made \ntheir neighbor. They are neighbors who do not answer a caller nor ward \noff trouble, nor pay heed to a mourner. \n \nIf they get rain they do not feel happy and if they face famine \nthey do not get disappointed. They are together but each one apart. They \nare close together but do not see each other. They are near but do not \nmeet. They are enduring and have no hatred. They are ignorant and their \nmalice has died away. There is no fear of trouble from them and no hope \nof their warding off (troubles). They have exchanged the back (surface) of \nthe earth with its stomach (interior), vastness with narrowness, family \nwith loneliness and light with darkness. They have come to it (this world) \nas they had left it with bare feet and naked bodies. They departed from it \nwith their acts towards the continuing life and everlasting house as Allah \nhas said the following:\n... As we caused the first creation, so will We cause its return. (It is) a \npromise binding Us, verily We were doing it. (Holy Quran, 21: 104)"

It has decorated itself with deception and \ndeceives with its decoration. It is a house which is low before Allah. So \nHe has mixed its lawful with its unlawful, its good with its evil, its life \nwith its death and its sweetness with its bitterness. Allah has not kept it \nclear for His lovers, nor has He been niggardly with it towards His foes. \nIts good is sparing. Its evil is ready at hand. Its collection will dwindle \naway. Its authority will be snatched away. Its habitation will face \ndesolation. What is the good of a house which falls down like fallen \nconstruction or what (Existent) good is there in an age which expires as \nthe provision exhausts, or of time which passes like walking? \n \nInclude whatever Allah has made obligatory on you in your \ndemands. Ask from Him fulfillment of what He has asked you to do. \nMake your ears hear the call of death before you are called by death. \nSurely the hearts of the abstemious weep in this world even though they \nmay(apparently) laugh and their grief increases even though they appear \nhappy. Their hatred for themselves is much even though they may be \nenvied for the subsistence they are allowed. Remembrance of death has \ndisappeared from your hearts while false hopes are present in you. So this \nworld has mastered you more than the next world and the immediate end \n(of this world) has removed you away from the remote one (of the next \nlife). You are brethren in the religion of Allah. Dirty natures and bad \nconscience have caused separation (disunity) among you. As a \nconsequence you do not bear one another’s burdens, nor do you advise \neach other, nor spend on each other, nor do you love one another. \n \nWhat is your condition? You feel satisfied with what little you \nhave secured from this world while much of the next world of which you \nhave been deprived does not grieve you. The little of this world which \nyou lose pains you so much so that it becomes apparent in your faces and \nin the lack of your endurance over whatever is taken away from you; as \nthough this world is your permanent abode and as though its wealth will \nstay with you for good. Nothing prevents anyone among you to disclose \nto his comrade the shortcomings he is afraid of, except the fear that the \ncomrade will also disclose to him similar defects. You have been \ndeceived together on leaving the next world and loving this world. Your \nreligion has become just licking with the tongue. It is like the work of one \nwho has finished his job and secured satisfaction of his master."

We praise Him for His bounties as for His trails. We \nseek His help against these hearts which are slow to obey what they have \nbeen commended but quick towards what they have been desisted from. \nWe seek His forgiveness from that which His knowledge covers and His \ndocument preserves knowledge which does not leave anything and \ndocument which does not omit anything. We believe in Him like the \nbelief of one who has seen the unknown and has attained the promised \nrewards - belief, the purity whereof keeps off from belief in partners of \nAllah and whose conviction removes doubt. \n \nWe testify that there is no god but Allah, the One, Who has no \npartner for Him and that Muhammad (h) is His slave and His Prophet \n(h), Allah may bless him and his descendants. These two testimonials \nintensify the utterance and raise the act. The scale wherein they will be \nplaced will not be light while the scale from which they are removed will \nnot become heavy. \nEnjoining People to Piety: \n \nO servants of Allah! I admonish you to fear Allah which is the \nprovision (for next world) and with it is (your) return. The provision will \ntake you (to your destination) and the return will be successful. The best \none, who is able to make people listen has called toward it and the best \nlistener has listened to it. So the caller has proclaimed and the listener has \nlistened and preserved. \n \nO creations of Allah! Certainly fear of Allah has saved the lovers \nof Allah from unlawful items and gave His dread to their hearts till their \nnights are passed in wakefulness and their days in thirst. So they achieve \ncomfort through trouble and copious watering through thirst. They \nregarded death to be near and, therefore, hastened towards (good) actions. \nThey rejected their desires and so they kept death in their sight. \n \nThen, this world is a place of destruction, tribulations, changes \nand lessons. As for destruction, the time has its bow pressed (to readiness) \nand its dart does not go amiss, its wound does not heal; it afflicts the \nliving with death, the healthy with ailment and the safe with distress. It is \nan eater who is not satisfied and a drinker whose thirst is never quenched. \nAs for tribulation, a man collects what he does not eat and builds wherein \nhe does not live. Then he goes out to Allah without carrying the wealth or \nshifting the building. \nAs for its changes, you see a pitiable man becoming enviable and \nan enviable man becoming pitiable. This is so because the wealth has \ngone and misfortune has come to him. As for its lessons, a man reaches \nnear (realization of) his desires when (suddenly) the approach of his death \ncuts them; then neither the desire is achieved nor the one who desires is \nspared. Glory to Allah, how deceitful are its pleasures, how thirst-rousing \nits quenching and how sunny its shade. That which approaches (i.e. death) \ncannot be sent back, he who goes away does not return. Glory to Allah, \nhow near is the living to the dead because he will meet him soon and how \nfar is the dead from the living because he has gone away from him. \n \nCertainly nothing is viler than evil except its punishment and \nnothing is better than good except its reward. In this world everything that \nis heard is better than what is seen, while of everything of the next world \nthat is seen is better than what is heard. So you should satisfy yourself by \nhearing rather than seeing and by thenews of the unknown. You should \nknow that what is little in this world but much in the next is better than \nwhat is much in this world but little in the next. In how many cases little \nis profitable while much causes loss. \n \nCertainly that which you have been commanded to do is wider \nthan what you have been refrained from and what has been made lawful \nfor you is more than what has been prohibited. Then give up what is less \nfor what is much and what is limited for what is vast. Allah has \nguaranteed your livelihood and has commanded you to act. Therefore, the \npursuit of that which has been guaranteed to you should not get \npreference over that whose performance has been enjoined upon you. \n \nBut by Allah, most certainly the status is that doubt has overtaken \nand certainty has been shattered and it seems as if what has been \nguaranteed to you is obligatory on you and what was made obligatory on \nyou has been taken away from you. So, hasten towards (good) actions and \ndread the suddenness of death because the return of age cannot be hoped \nfor tomorrow, as the return of livelihood can be hoped. Whatever is \nmissed from livelihood today may be hoped tomorrow with increase, but \nwhatever is lost from the age yesterday, its return cannot be expected \ntoday. Hope can be only for that which is to come, while about that which \nis passed there is only disappointment. So Afear Allah as He ought to be \nfeared and do not die until you are (true) Muslim (Holy Quran, 3: 102)."

They are moaning like the moaning of mothers for their \n(dead) sons. They are tired of going to their meadows and longing for \ntheir watering places. O Lord! have mercy on the groan of the groaning \nand yearn of the yearning. O Lord! have mercy on their bewilderment and \ntheir passages and their groaning in their yards. \n \nLord! We have come out to You when the years of drought have \ncrowded over us like (a herd of) thin camels and rain clouds have \nabandoned us. You are the hope for the afflicted and succor for the \nseeker. We call You when the people have lost hope, when cloud have \nbeen denied and cattle have died; do not seize us for our deeds and do not \ncatch us for our sins. Spread Your mercy over us through raining clouds, \nrain fed blossoming, amazing vegetation and heavy downpours with \nwhich all that was dead regains life and all that was lost returns. \n \nLord! Give rain from You which should be life-giving, satisfying, \nthorough, widely scattered, pure, blissful, plentiful and invigorating. Its \nvegetation should be exuberant and its branches full of fruits and its green \nleaves. With it You invigorates the weak among Your creatures and \nbrings back to life the dead among Your cities. \n \nLord! Give rain from You with which our highlands get covered \nwith green herbage, streams get flowing, our slopes grow green, our fruits \nthrive, our cattle prosper, our far flung areas get watered and our dry areas \nget its benefit, with Your vast blessing and immeasurable grant on Your \ndistressed universe and Your untamed beasts. And pour upon us rain \nwhich is drenching, continuous and heavy; wherein one cycle of rain \nclashes with the other and one rain drop pushes another (into a continuous \nchain). Its lightning should not be deceptive, its cheek not rainless, its \nwhite clouds not scattered and rain not light, so that the famine-stricken \nthrive with its abundant herbage and the drought stricken come to life \nwith its bliss. Certainly, You pours down rain after the people lose hopes \nand spreads Your mercy, since You are the Guardian, the praiseworthy. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “The wonderful expressions of \nthis sermon are: Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words insahat jibaluna means \nthe mountains cracked on account of drought. It is said that insaha \nthawbah when it is torn. It is also said that insaha’n-nabtu or saba or \nsawwaha when vegetation withers and dries up.” \n \nHis words wa hamat dawabbuna means became thirsty, as huyam \nmeans thirst. \n \nHis words hadabiru’s-sinin are the plural of hidbar. It means: The \ncamel whom treading has thinned. So Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) likened \nwith such or camel the year in which drought had occurred. The Arab \npoet Dhu ar-Rumma has said the following: \n \nThese thin camels remain in their places, facing hardships and \nmove only when we take them to some dry area. \n \nNotice his words wa la qaza’in rababuha. Here, al-qaza means \nsmall pieces of cloud scattered all around. \n \nHis words wa la shaffanin dhihabuha stand for wa la dhata \nshaffanin dhihabuha. Ash-shaffan means the cold wind and adh-dhihab \nmeans light rain. He omitted the world dhata from here because of the \nlistener’s knowledge of it."

Rather, \ntheir heart’s slogan was as the Persian hemistich says the following: “We are \nashamed why we have remained alive.”He who has even a slight brilliance of \nthese qualities can alone be called the follower of the Descendants of the Prophet \n(h) of the Shi`a of Ali; otherwise, it will be a word which has lost its meaning and \nbeen bereft of its dignity through misuse. Thus tradition has it that Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) saw a group of men at his door and inquired from Qanbar who they \nwere and he answered they were his Shi`as. On hearing this Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) had a frown on his forehead and said, “Why are they called Shi`as? they \nhave no sign of Shi`as. Thereupon, Qanbar inquired as to what were the signs of \nShi`as and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) replied: “Their bellies are thin through \nhunger, their lips dry through thirst and their eyes bleared through weeping.” \nleapt (toward it) as she-camels leap towards their young. They took their \nswords out of the sheaths and went out into the world in groups and rows. \nSome of them perished and some survived. The good news of survival \ndoes not please them nor do they get condoled about the dead. Their eyes \nhave turned white with weeping. Their bellies are emaciated because of \nfasting. Their lips are dry because of (constant) praying. Their color is \npale because of wakefulness. Their faces bear the dust of God-fearing. \nThese are my comrades who have departed. We should be justified if we \nfeel eager for them and bite our hands in their separation. \n \nCertainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to \nunfasten the knots of religion one by one and to cause division among you \nin place of unity. Keep away from his evil ideas and enchantments and \naccept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your \nminds."

Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the \nfollowing:\n \nThen you divide yourself into two groups. One of those who were \nin Siffin and other of those who were not present the re, so that I may \naddress each as I see suitable. \n \nThen the Imam (x) shouted the following to the people: \n \nStop talking and keep quiet to listen to what I say. Turn your \nhearts to me. Whomever we ask for testimony, he should give it according \nto his knowledge about it. \n \nThen he conversed with them in length. During the \nconversation, he said the following: \n \nWhen they raised the Holy Quran by way of deceit, craft, artifice \nand cheating, did you not say that they are our brothers and comrades in \naccepting Islam? They want us to cease fighting and ask for protection \nAddressed Them Thus: \nthrough the Book of Allah, the Glorified. Our opinion is to agree with \nthem and to end their troubles. Then I said to you, In this affair, the outer \nside is Faith but the inner side is enmity. Its beginning is pity and the end \nis repentance. Consequently you should stick to your status and remain \nsteadfast on your path. You should press your teeth (to put all your might) \nin jihad and should not pay heed to the shouts of one who shouts.163 If he \nis answered, he will mislead, but if he is left (answered), he will be \ndisgraced.\n \nBut when this thing (arbitration) was done I found that you \nagreed to it. By Allah, if I had refused it, it will not have been obligatory \non me. Nor will Allah have laid its sin on me. And by Allah, not that I \nhave accepted it, I alone am the rightful person who should be followed, \nfor certainly the Holy Quran is with me. I have never forsaken it since I \nadopted its company. We have been with the Prophet (h) in battles \nwherein those killed were fathers, sons, brothers and relations of one \nanother. Nevertheless, every trouble and hardship just increased us in our \nbelief, in our treading on the right path, in submission to (the Divine) \ncommand and in endurance of the pain of wounds. \n \nWe now had to fight our brethren in Islam because of entry into \nIslam of misguidance, crookedness, doubts and (wrong) interpretation. \nHowever, if we find any way by which Allah may collect us together in \nour disorder and by which we may come near each other in whatever \ncommon remains between us we will accept it and will give up everything \nelse.\n \nIbn Abul-Hadid writes that this sermon comprises three parts \nwhich do not fit together because Sayyid ar-Radi selected some parts of \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s sermons and did not record other parts as a \nresult of which the continuity of utterance was not maintained. Thus, one \npart ends at “If he is left unanswered, he will be disgraced”, the other at \n“And endurance at the pain of wound” and the third runs till the end of \nthe sermon."

Grit your teeth because this will make the swords skip off the \nskull and dodge on the sides of the spears for it changes the direction of \ntheir blades. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives \npeace to the heart. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness. \n \nDo not let your banner bend, nor leave it alone. Do not give it to \nanyone except the brave and the defenders of honor among you because \nthey alone endure the befalling of troubles; they surround the banners and \nencircle them on both sides, their rear and their front. They do not \nseparate from them lest they give them (to the enemy). They do not go \nahead of them lest they leave them alone. Everyone should deal with his \nadversary and also help his comrade by his own life and should not leave \nthe adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his comrade \njoin against him. \n \nBy Allah! Even if you run away from the sword of today you will \nnot remain safe from the sword of the next world. You are the foremost \namong the Arabs and great figures. Certainly in running away there is the \nwrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame. And certainly run \nwho runs does not lengthen his life, nor does anything come to intervene \nbetween him and his day (of death). Who is there to go towards Allah like \nthe thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies under the edges of spears. \nToday the reputations (about the valor of warriors) will be tested. \n \nBy Allah! I am more eager to meet them (in combat) than they \nare for (returning to) their houses. O Lord! If they reject truth, disperse \ntheir group, divide their words (opinion) and destroy them on account of \ntheir sins. \n \nThey will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking \nof spears causes piercing (of wounds) through which wind may pass. And \nthe hitting of swords cuts through the skull, cleaves bones and breaks \nforearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after contingent and \nassaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support, till \ntheir cities are continuously assailed by force after force and till the horses \ntrample even the extreme ends of the lands, the tracks of their beast and \ntheir meadows. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Add-da’q means trampling, \ne.g. ataduqqul-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum (the horses trample the \nground with their hoofs). Anawahini ardihim means lands opposite each \nother. It is said, amanazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu, meaning: The houses \nof so-and-so face each other. \n \n Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon on the \noccasion of the battle of Siffin. This battle was fought in the year 37 A.H. \nbetween Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and the governor of Syria, \nMu`awiyah, for the so-called avenging for the killing of Caliph Othman. \nBut in reality it was nothing more than Mu`awiyah who had been the \nautonomous governor of Syria from Caliph Omer’s days. He, not wanting \nto lose that status by swearing allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nbut wanting to keep his authority intact by exploiting the killing of Caliph \nOthman, for later events, proved, that after securing the government, he \ndid not take any practical step to avenge Othman’s blood. And he never \nspoke, not even through omission, about the killers of `Othman. \n \nAlthough from the first day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) realized \nthat was inevitable, it was still necessary to exhaust all pleas., therefore, \nMonday the 12th Rajab, 36 A.H. he returned to Kufa after the Battle of \nJamal. He sent Jarir ibn Abdillah al-Bajali with a letter to Mu`awiyah at \nDamascus wherein he wrote that the Muhajirun and the Ansar had sworn \nallegiance to him and that he too should first swear him allegiance and \nthereafter place the case of Othman’s killing before him so that he could \npass verdict the reon according to the Holy Quran and Sunnah. But \nMu`awiyah detained Jarir on several pretexts and after consulting Amr \nibn al-As, staged a rebellion on the excuse of Othman’s killing. And with \nthe help of important persons of Syria, he convinced the ignorant people \nthat the liability for Othman’s life lay on Ali (x) and that he, with his \nconduct, had encouraged the besiegers and had given them protection. \nMeanwhile he hung the blood-stained shirt of Othman and the amputated \nfingers of his wife Na’ila daughter of al-Farafisah on the pulpit in the \nCentral Mosque of Damascus around which seventy thousand Syrians \ncried and swore the pledge to avenge Othman’s blood. When Mu`awiyah \nhad roused the feelings of the Syrians to such an extent that they were \ndetermined to lay down their lives and be killed, he secured their \nallegiance on the cause of avenging Othman’s blood and busied himself \nin equipping for the battle. Thereafter, he showed all this to Jarr then sent \nhim back mortified. \n \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) learned of these matters \nthrough Jarir ibn Abdillah al-Bajali, he was forced to rise against \nMu`awiyah, ordering Malik ibn Habib al-Yarbu’i to mobilize their forces \nin the valley of An-Nukhayla. Consequently, people from the suburbs of \nKufa began arriving there in large numbers, till they exceeded eighty \nthousand. First of all, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent a vanguard \ncontingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi and \nanother of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn Hani al-Harithi \ntowards Syria. After the departure of this vanguard contingent he himself \nset out for Syria at the head of the remaining army on Wednesday the 5th \nof Shawwal. When he was out of the boundary of Kufa he offered zuhr \n(noon) prayer and after staying at Dayr Abu Musa, Nahr (river) Nars, \nQuba’t Qubbin, Babil (Babylon), Dayr Ka`b, Kerbala’, Sabat, Bahurasini, \nal-Anbar and Jazira arrived at ar-Riqqa. The people of this place were in \nfavor of Othman and at this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah al-Asadi \nwas putting up eight hundred men. These people had left Kufa to join \nMu`awiyah after deserting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). When they had \nseen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s force, they had dismantled the bridge over \nthe River Euphrates so that the Imam’s army should not cross over to the \nother side of the river. But at the threatening of Malik ibn al-Harith al-\nAshtar an-Nakh`i they were frightened. After consultations among \nthemselves they put the bridge together again and Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) passed over it with his army. When he alighted on the other side \nof the river he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were also camped there along \nwith their men since both of them had adopted the land route. When, on \nreaching here, they found that Mu`awiyah was advancing with his armies \ntowards the Euphrates and thinking that they will not be able to face him, \nthey stopped there waiting for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). When they \nhad given the reason for their stopping the re, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\naccepted their plea and sent them forward. When they reached surat ar-\nRum they found that Abul-Awar al-Salami was camping there with his \narmy. Both of them informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) of this, \nwhereupon he despatched Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakhi in their \nwake as the Officer in Command, cautioning him not to initiate the \nfighting but to try to counsel them and appraise them of the correct status \nas far as possible. In this way, on reaching there Malik al-Ashtar \nencamped a little distance away. Fighting could have commenced any \nmoment, but he did not interfere with the other side nor did he take any \nstep by which fighting could have been commenced. But Abul-A`war \nsuddenly attacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of \nthe sheaths and prepared to repulse them. Clashes between the two sides \nwent on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness of \nnight Abul-A`war fled away. Since fighting had already commenced, \nsoon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander, Hashim ibn \n`Utbah al-Mirqal az-Zuhri, took his status in the battlefield. From the \nother side also a contingent came to face him and the flames of fighting \nrose. At last Malik al-Ashtar challenged Abul-Awar to fight him, but he \ndid not dare to face him and towards the evening Malik al-Ashtar went \nonward with his men. The next day Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) reached \nthere with his force and set off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent \nand other forces. Mu`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his \nbases. He had also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it. \nOn reaching there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent him word to remove \nthe guard from Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon theiraqis took out \ntheir swords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates. When this \nstage was over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent Bashir ibn Amr al-\nAnsari, Sa’id ibn Qays al-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rab`i at-Tamimi to \nMu`awiyah to apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him \nagree to settlement and allegiance. But his relay was that they could not \nby any means let Othman’s blood remain neglected and that now the \nsword alone will arbitrate between them. Consequently in the month of \nDhul-Hijja 36 A.H. both the parties decided on war and warriors from \neach side came out into the field to face their adversary. Those who \nentered the battlefield from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side were: Hijr ibn \nAdiy al-Kindi, Shabath ibn Rab`i at-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al-Mu’ammar, \nZiyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at-Taymi, Sa’id ibn \nQays al-Hamdani, Qays ibn Sa`d al-Ansari and Malik ibn al-Harith al-\nAshtar an-Nakh`i while from the Syrians there were, `Abd ar-Rahman ibn \nKhalid ibn al-Walid al-Makhzumi, Abul-Awar al-Salami, Habib ibn \nMaslamah al-Fihri, `Abdullah ibn Dhi’l-Kala’al-Himyari, `Ubaydullah \nibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al-Kindi and Hamzah ibn \nMalik al-Hamdani. When the month of Dhul-Hijja came to end the \nfighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from the 1st of Safar \nfighting was resumed and both parties arrayed themselves opposite each \nother, equipped with swords, spears and other weapons. On Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib’s side Malik al-Ashtar was in command of the horsemen and \nAmmar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers of Kufa while Sahl ibn Hanayf al-\nAnsari was in command of the horsemen and Qays ibn Sa`d of the foot \nsoldiers of Basra. The banner of the army was given to Hashim ibn Utbah. \nIn the army of the Syrians on the right hand contingent ibn Dhi’l-Kala’ \nwas in command, while on the left hand contingent Habb ibn Maslamah, \non horsemen Amr ibn al-As and on foot soldiers ad-Dahhak ibn Qays al-\nFihri were in command. \n \nOn the first day Malik ibn al-Ashtar entered the battlefield with \nhis men and from the other side Habib ibn Maslamah came out with his \nmen to face him and from both sides a fierce battle ensued. Throughout \nthe day swords clashed with swords and spears with spears. \n \nThe next day, Hashim ibn Utbah came out with Ali’s army and \nfrom the other side Abul-A`war with his footmen came to face him. When \nthe two armies approached each other, horsemen fell upon horsemen and \nfootmen upon footmen and continued attacking each other and they \nendured with great patience and steadfastness. \n \nOn the third day, Ammar ibn Yasir and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr came \nout with horsemen and foot soldiers and from the other side `Amr ibn al-\nAs came forward with a big force. Ziyad attacked the horsemen of the \nopposite side and Malik al-Ashtar attacked the foot soldiers so furiously \nthat the enemy’s men lost ground and, failing to offer resistance, returned \nto their camps. \n \nOn the fourth day Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya appeared on the \nbattlefield with his men. From the other side `Ubaydullah ibn `Umar came \nforward with the Syrian army and both the armies had a serious \nencounter.\nOn the fifth day, Abdullah ibn Abbas came forward and from the \nother side al-Walid ibn Uqba ibn Abu Mu’ayt came to face him. Abdullah \nibn Abbas carried the assaults with great steadfastness and courage, \ngiving such a brave fight that the enemy left the field in retreat. \n \nOn the sixth day, Qays ibn Sa`d al-Ansari came forward with the \narmy and to face him Ibn Dhi’l-Kala’ came out with his contingent. A \nfierce fighting ensued; at every step, bodies were seen falling and blood \nflowing like streams. At last, the darkness of the night separated the two \narmies. \n \nOn the seventh day, Malik al-Ashtar came out and to face him, \nHabib ibn Maslamah came forward with his men and fighting raged till \nzuhr (noon). \n \nOn the eighth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) himself came out \nwith the army and made such an assault that the entire battlefield quaked \nand piercing through the ranks and warding off shots of arrows and spears \nhe came and stood between both the lines. Then he challenged \nMu`awiyah, whereupon the latter, along with Amr ibn al-As, came a bit \ncloser. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said to him: `Amr! Come out and face \nme. Let whoever kills the other be the ruler, whereupon `Amr ibn al-As \nsaid to Mu`awiyah, “Ali (x) is right. Gather a little courage and face him.” \nMu`awiyah replied, “I am not prepared to waste my life at your \ntaunting.”Having said this much, he went back. When Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) saw him retreating he smiled and himself too returned. The \ndaring with which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) led the attacks in Siffin \ncan only be called a miraculous feat. Thus, whenever he came out \nchallenging in the battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed into utter \ndisarray and confusion and even courageous combatants hesitated to \nappear against him. That is why on a few occasions he came onto the \nbattlefield in changed outfit so that the enemy should not recognize him \nand someone should be prepared to engage with him personally. Once \nArar ibn Adham came from the other side to engage with al-Abbas ibn \nRabi`ah al-Harith ibn Abdul-Muttalib. They remained engaged but neither \ncould defeat the other, until al-Abbas chanced to see that a link of his \nadversary’s amour was loose. With a swift stroke he entangled the point \nof his sword in it then with a quick jerk he cut through a few more links. \nThen with true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went straight into \nhis bosom. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir. Mu`awiyah was \nstartled at this noise and on coming to know that Arar ibn Adham had \nbeen slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there was anyone to take \nrevenge for Arar ibn Adham and kill al-Abbas. Al-Abbas came to Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) to seek permission. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\ndetained him, put on al-Abbas outfit and riding on al-Abbas’s horse \nentered the battlefield. Taking him to be al-Abbas, the Lakhams said the \nfollowing: “So you have got your chief’s permission. In reply Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) recited the following verse: \nPermission (to fight is) given unto those upon whom war is made \nfor they have been oppressed and verily, to help them, Allah is Most \nPotent. (Holy Quran, 22: 39) \n \nA man came out from the other side shouting like an elephant, ran \namok and assaulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), but the Imam avoided \nthe blow then gave such a clean cut with his sword to the other’s back that \nhe was split into two. People thought the blow had gone without avail, but \nwhen his horse jumped his two separate parts fell on the ground. After \nhim another man came out but he too was finished in the twinkling of an \neye. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) challenged others but from the strokes of \nhis sword the enemy came to know that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) in the outfit of al-Abbas and so none dared come to face him. \n \nOn the ninth day, the right wing was under the command of \nAbdullah ibn Budayi and the left wing under that of Abdullah ibn Abbas. \nIn the center was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) himself. On the other side, \nHabib ibn Maslamah commanded the Syrian army. When both the lines \nhad come face-to-face with each other, the valiant soldiers drew out their \nswords and pounced upon one another like ferocious lions and fighting \nraged on all sides. The banner of the right wing of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib’s army was revolving in the hands of Banu Hamdan. Whenever \nanyone of them fell, martyred, someone else will pick up the banner. First \nof all Kurayb ibn Shurayh raised the banner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn \nShurayh took it up, then Marthad ibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn \nShurayh then Yarim ibn Shurayh, then Sumayr ibn Shurayh and after the \nkilling of all these six brothers the banner was taken up by Sufyan, then \nAbd, then Kurayb, the three sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred. After \nthat the banner was lifted by two brothers (sons) of Bashir namely \n`Umayr and al-Harithi and when they too fell martyred, Wahab ibn \nKurayb took up the banner. On this day the enemy’s greater attention was \non the right wing and its assaults were so fierce that the men lost ground \nand began to retreat from the battlefield. Only three hundred men \nremained with the Officer in Command Abdullah ibn Budayl. On seeing \nthis Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) asked Malik al-Ashtar to call them back \nand challenge them as to where they were fleeing. If the days of life are \nover they cannot avoid death by running away. Now the defeat of the \nright wing could not be without effect on the left wing, so Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) turned to the left wing and advanced forward, forcing \nthrough the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of Banu Umayyah named \nAhmar said to him, “Allah may cause me to die if I fail to slay you \ntoday!”On hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s slave Kaysan leapt \nover him but was killed by him. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saw \nthis, he caught him by the skirt of his amour and, picking him up, threw \nhim down so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam\nHassan (x) and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya came forward and \ndispatched him to Hell. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik al-\nAshtar and his having made them feel ashamed, those who retreated came \nback and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy they \nreached the place where Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by the \nenemy. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt \ntowards Mu`awiyah’s tent with drawn sword. Malik al-Ashtar tried to \nstop him but he could not and, killing seven Syrians, he reached the tent \nof Mu`awiyah. When Mu`awiyah noticed him close by he ordered him to \nbe stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered and the Syrians \ncrowded over him and killed him. When Malik al-Ashtar saw this he \nproceeded forward with the combatants of Banu Hamdan and Banu \nMadhhaj for an attack on Mu`awiyah and began dispersing the contingent \non guard around him. When, out of the five circles of his guards only one \nremained to be dispersed, Mu`awiyah put his foot in the stirrup of his \nhorse in order to run away, but on someone’s encouragement again \nstopped. On another side of the battlefield a tumult was raging from one \nend to the other by the swords of Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn \nUtbah. From whatever side Ammar passed, the companions (of the Holy \nProphet [h]) flocked around him then made such a joint assault that \ndestruction spread throughout the enemy lines. When Mu`awiyah saw \nthem advancing he threw his fresh forces towards them. But he continued \ndisplaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords and \nspears. At last Abul-Adiyah al-Juhani hit him with a spear from which he \ncould not balance himself then Ibn Hawiy (Jawn as-Saksiki) came \nforward and slew him. Ammar ibn Yasir’s death caused tumult in \nMu`awiyah’s ranks because about him they had heard the Holy Prophet \n(h) having said the following: “Ammar will be killed at the hands of a \nrebellious party. Thus before he fell as martyr Dhul-Kala’ had said to \n`Amr ibn al-As, “I see Ammar on Ali’s side; are we that rebellious \nparty?” Amr ibn al-As had assured him that eventually Ammar would join \nthem, but when he was killed fighting on Ali’s side, the rebellious party \nstood exposed and no room was left for any other interpretation. \nNevertheless Mu`awiyah started telling the Syrians: “We did not kill \nAmmar, but Ali did it because he brought him to the battlefield.”When \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) heard this cunning sentence, he remarked, “In \nthat case, the Holy Prophet (h) killed (his uncle the valiant) Hamzah \nbecause he had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud.” Hashim ibn \nUtbah also fell in this conflict. He was killed by al-Harith ibn Mundhir at-\nTanukhi. After him the banner of the contingent was taken over by his son \nAbdullah.\n \nWhen such fearless warriors were gone, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) said to the warriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi`ah, “To me, \nyou are like amour and spear. Get up and teach these rebels a \nlesson.”Consequently, twelve thousand combatants from the tribes of \nRabi`ah and Hamdan stood up, swords in hand. The banner was taken up \nby Hudyan ibn al-Mundhir. Entering the lines of the enemy, they used \ntheir swords in such a way that heads began to drop, bodies fell in huge \nheaps and on every side streams of blood flowed. And the assaults of \nthose swordsmen knew no stopping till the day began to end with all its \ndevastation. And the gloom of eve set in, ushering in that fearful night \nwhich is known in history as the night of al-Harir, wherein the clashing of \nweapons, the hoofs of horses and the hue and cry of the Syrians created \nsuch notice that even voices reaching the ears could not be heard. On \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s side, his wrong-crushing slogans raised waves \nof courage and valor and on the enemy’s side they shook the hearts in \ntheir bosoms. The battle was at its zenith. The quivers of the bowmen had \nbecome empty. The stalks of the spears had been broken. Hand to hand \nfighting went on with swords only and dead bodies collected in heaps, till \nby morning the number of killed had exceeded thirty thousand. \n \nOn the tenth day, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men showed the \nsame high morale. On the right wing, Malik al-Ashtar held the command \nand on the left wing Abdullah ibn Abbas. Assaults went on like the \nassaults of new soldiers. Signs of defeat appeared on the Syrians and they \nwere about to leave the battlefield and run away, when five hundred Holy \nQurans were raised on spears changing the entire face of the battle. \nMoving swords stopped, the weapon of deceit was successful and the way \nwas clear for wrong to hold its sway. \nIn this battle forty-five thousand Syrians were killed while \ntwenty-five thousand Iraqis fell as martyrs as we read in Kitab Siffin by \nNasr ibn Muzahim al-Minqari [d. 212 A.H.] and Tarikh al-Tabari, Vol. 1, \npp. 3256-3349)."

The Holy Quran is a book covered between two flaps and it \ndoes not speak. It should, therefore, necessarily have an interpreter. Men \nalone can be such interpreters. When these people invited us to name the \nHoly Quran as the arbitrator between us, we could not be the party turning \naway from the Book of Allah, since Allah has said the following: \n \nIf you quarrel about anything refer it to Allah \n \nand the Prophet (h). (Holy Quran, 4: 59) \n \nReference to Allah means that we decide according to the Holy \nQuran while reference to the Prophet (h) means that we follow his \nSunnah. Now therefore, if arbitration were truly done through the Book of \nAllah (Holy Quran), we will be the most rightful of all people for the \nCaliphate; or if it were done by the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (h), we \nwill be the most preferable of them. \n \nConcerning your point why I allowed a time lag between myself \nand them with regard to the Arbitration, I did so in order that the ignorant \nmay find out (the truth) and one who already knows may hold with it \nfirmly. Possibly Allah may, as a result of this peace, improve the \ncondition of these people and they will not be caught by the throats and \nwill not, before indication of the right, fall into rebellion as before. \nCertainly the best man before Allah is he who loves most to act according \nto right, even though it causes him hardship and grief, rather than \naccording to wrong, even though it gives him benefit and increase. \n \nSo, where are you being mislead and from where have you been \nbrought (to this state)? Be prepared to march to the people who have \ndeviated from the right and do not see it, have been entangled in wrong-\ndoing and are not corrected. They are away from the Book and turned \nfrom the (right) path. You are not trustworthy to rely upon, nor are you \nholders of honor to be adhered to. You are very bad in kindling the fire of \nfighting. Woe to you! I had to bear a lot of worries from you. Some days I \ncall to you (to jihad) and some days, I speak to you in confidence. You \nare neither true free men at the time of call, nor trustworthy brothers at the \ntime of speaking in confidence."

    "text": "About the Kharijites : \nIf you do not stop believing that I have gone wrong and have \nbeen misled, why do you consider that the common men among the \nfollowers of the Prophet Muhammad (h) have gone astray like me and \naccuse them with my wrong and hold them unbelievers on account of my \nsins. You are holding your swords on your shoulders and using them right \nand wrong. You are confusing those who have committed sins with those \nwho have not. You know that the Prophet (h) stoned the protected \n(married) adulterers, then he also said his burial prayer and allowed his \nsuccessors to inherit from him. He amputated (the hand of) the thief and \nwhipped the unprotected (unmarried) adulterer, but thereafter allowed \ntheir shares from the booty and they married Muslim women. Thus the \nProphet (h) took them to ask for their sins and also abided by Allah’s \ncommands about them, but did not disallow them their rights created by \nIslam, nor did he remove their names from its followers. \n \nCertainly you are the most evil of all persons and are those whom \nSatan has put on his lines and thrown out into his wayless land. With \nregard to me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who \nloves me too much and the hatred which takes him away from \nrightfulness. The best man with regard to me is he who is on the middle \ncourse. So be with him and be with the great majority (of Muslims) \nbecause Allah’s hand (of protection) is on keeping unity. You should \nbeware of division because the one isolated from the group is (a prey) to \nSatan just as the one isolated from the flock of sheep is (a prey) to the \nwolf.\n \nBeware! Whoever calls to this course, kill him, even though he \nmay be under this headband of mine. Certainly the two arbitrators were \nappointed to revive what the Holy Quran revives and to destroy what the \nHoly Quran destroys. Revival means to unite on it (in a matter) and \ndestruction means to divide on a matter. If the Holy Quran drives us to \nthem we should follow them and if it drives them to us they should follow \nup. May you have no father! (Woe to you), I did not cause you any \nmisfortune, nor have I deceived you in any matter, nor created any \nconfusion. Your own group had unanimously suggested in favor of these \ntwo men and we bound them that they will not exceed the Holy Quran but \nthey deviated from it and abandoned the right although both of them were \nconversant with it. This wrong-doing was the dictate of their hearts. So \nthey trod upon it, although we had stipulated that in arbitrating with \njustice and sticking to rightfulness they will avoid the evil of their own \nviews and the mischief of their own verdict (but since this has happened \nthe award is not acceptable to us)."

    "text": "About Important Events in Basra :.\nO Ahnaf! It is as though I see him advancing with an army which \nhas neither dust nor noise, nor rustling of reins, nor neighing of horses. \nThey are trampling the ground with their feet as if they are the feet of \nostriches.\n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\npointed to the Chief of the Blacks (Sahibuz-Zanj).” \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “Woe unto you (O people of \nBasra’s) inhabited streets and decorated houses which possess wings like \nthe wings of vultures and trunks like the trunks of elephants. They are the \npeople from among whom if one is killed he is not mourned and if one is \nlost he is not searched for. I turn this world over on its face, value it only \naccording to its (low) value and look at it with an eye suitable to it.” \nPart of the same sermon: \nReferring to the Turks (Mongols), he said, \nI can see a people whose faces are like shields covered with \nroughly-scraped skins. They outfit themselves in silken and woolen clothe \ns and hold dear excellent horses. Their killing and bloodshed shall take \nplace freely till the wounded shall walk over the dead and the number of \nrunners-away shall be less than those taken prisoner. \n \nOne of his companions said to him, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib! \nYou have been given knowledge of hidden things,” whereupon Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) smiled and said to the man who belonged to the tribe of \nBanu Kalb, “O brother of Kalb! This is not knowledge of hidden things \n(ilmul-ghayb)! These matters have been acquired from him (namely in \nProphet (h)) who knew them. As regard knowledge of hidden things, \nthat means knowledge of the Day of Judgement and the things covered by \nAllah in the verse; \nVerily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the \nHour. (Holy Quran, 31: 34) \n \nTherefore, Allah, and only Allah, knows what is there in the \nwombs, whether male or female, ugly or handsome, if he/she will be \ngenerous or miserly, mischievous or pious, a fuel for Hell or in the \ncompany of the Prophet (h) in Paradise. This is the knowledge of the \nhidden things which is not known to anyone save Allah. All else is that \nwhose knowledge Allah passed on to His Prophet (h) and he passed it on \nto me and prayed for me that my bosom may retain it and my ribs may \nhold it. \n \nAli ibn Muhammad was born in the village of Warzanin in the \nsuburbs of Ray and belonged to the Azariqah sect of the Kharijites. He \nclaimed to be a Sayyid (descendant of the Holy Prophet (h)) by showing \nhimself the son of Muhammad ibn Ahmed al-Mukhtafi ibn Isa ibn Zayd \nibn Ali ibn al-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib, but the experts on \ngenealogy, as well as biographers, have all rejected his claim to being a \nSayyid and have given his father’s name as Muhammad ibn Abd ar-\nRahim instead of Muhammad ibn Ahmed. The former was from the tribe \nof Abdul-Qays and had been born of a Sindi maid-slave. \n \nAli ibn Muhammad (h) rose as an insurgent in 255 A.H. in the \nreign of al-Muhtadi Billah and associated with him the people from the \nsuburbs of Basra on promise of money, wealth and freedom. He entered \nBasra on the 17th Shawwal, 255 A.H. killing and looting and in only two \ndays he put to death thirty thousand individuals, men, women and \nchildren and displayed extreme opposition, bloodshed, savageness and \nferocity. He dismantled houses, burnt mosques and after continuous \nkilling and devastation for fourteen years, was killed in the month of \nSafar, 270 A.H. in the reign of Muwaffaq Billah. Then people got rid of \nhis devastating deeds. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s prediction is one of those predictions \nwhich throw light on his knowledge of the unknown. The details of his \narmy given by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) namely that there will be \nneither the neighing of horses nor the rustling of weapons the rein is a \nhistorical fact. The historian al-Tabari has written that when this man \nreached near al-Karkh (a sector of Baghdad) with the intention of \ninstruction, the people of that place welcomed him and a man presented \nhim a horse for which no rein could be found despite a search. At last he \nrode it using a rope for the rein. Similarly there were at that time only \nthree swords in his force-one with himself, one with Ali ibn Aban al-\nMuhallabi and one with Muhammad ibn Salm but later they collected \nsome more weapons by marauding. \n \nThe prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) stated above is \nabout the attack of the Tartars (Mongols) who were inhabitants of the \nMongolian desert in the north west of Turkey. These semi-savage tribes \nlived by marauding, killing and devastating. They used to fight among \nthemselves and attack neighboring areas. Each tribe had a separate chief \nwho was deemed responsible for their protection. Chingiz [Jenkiz] Khan \n(Temujin) who was one of the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very \nbrave and courageous had risen to organize all their divided tribes into \none and, despite their opposition he succeeded in overpowering them \nthrough his might and sagacity. Collecting a large number under his \nbanner he rose in 606 A.H. like a torrent and went on dominating cities \nand ruining populations till he conquered the area up to North China. \n \nWhen his authority was established he offered his terms of \nsettlement to Ala’ud-Din Khwarazm Shah, ruler of the neighboring \ncountry of Turkey and through a deputation concluded an agreement with \nhim that Tartar traders will be allowed to visit his country for trade and \ntheir life and property will not be subject to any harm. For some time they \ntraded freely without fear but on one occasion Ala’ud-Din accused them \nof spying, seized their goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar. \nWhen Chingiz Khan learned of the breach of the agreement and the \nkilling of Tartar merchants his eyes cast forth flames and he began \ntrembling with rage. He sent word to Ala’ud-Din to return the goods of \nthe Tartar merchants and to hand over to him the ruler of Atrar. Ala’ud-\nDin, who was mad with power and authority, did not pay any heed and \nacting short-sightedly killed even the plenipotentiary of Jenkiz Khan. \nNow Chinzing Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with blood. He \nrose with his sword in hand and the Tartar warriors leapt towards Bukhara \non their speedy stallions. Ala’ud-Din came out with four hundred \nthousand combatants to face him but could not resist the incessant \nassaults of the Tartars and having been vanquished only after a few \nattacks ran away to Nishabur across the river Jaxartes (Sihun). The \nTartars smashed Bukhara and razed it to the ground. They pulled down \nschools and mosques, burning the houses to ashes and killing men and \nwomen without distinction. The next year they assaulted Samarqand and \ndevastated it completely. After the fight of Ala’ud-Din, his son Jalalu’d-\nDin Khwarazm Shah had assumed the reins of government. The Tartars \nchased him also and for ten years he fled from one place to the other but \ndid not fall in their hands. At last he crossed over the river out of the \nboundaries of his realm. During this time the Tartars did their utmost to \nruin populated lands and to annihilate humanity. No city escaped their \nruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they went \nthey upset the kingdom, overthrown governments and in a short time \nestablished their authority over the northern region of Asia. \n \nWhen Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan \nsucceeded him. He searched out Jalalu’d-Din in 628 A.H. And killed him. \nAfter him Mongka Khan, the son of the other son of Chingiz Khan, \noccupied the throne. After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a \npart of the country and the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother \nHulagu Khan. On the division of the whole realm among the grandsons of \nChingiz Khan, Hulagu Khan was thinking of conquering Muslims area \nwhen the Hanafite of Khurasan in enmity with the Shafi’ite invited him to \nattack Khurasan. He, therefore, led an assault on Khurasan and the \nHanafite, thinking themselves to be safe from the Tartars, opened the city \ngates for them. But the Tartars did not make any distinction between \nHanafite and Shafi’ite and killed whoever fell to their hands. After killing \nmost of its population they took it in occupation. These very differences \nbetween the Hanafite and the Shafi’ite opened for him the door of \nconquest up to Iraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage \nincreased and in 656 A.H. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred \nthousand Tartars, al-Musta’sim Billah’s army and the people of Baghdad \njointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this torrent of \ncalamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad on the day of \nAshura’ carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They remained busy in \nkilling for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in the streets and all the \nalleys were filled with dead bodies. Hundred of thousands of people were \nput to the sword while al-Musta’sim Billah was trampled to death under \nfoot. Only those people who hid themselves in wells or underground \nplaces and hid from their sight could survive. This was the devastation of \nBaghdad which shook of Abbasid Kingdom to its foundation, so that its \nflag could never fly thereafter. \n \nSome historians have laid the blame of this ruin on ibn al-Alqami \n(Abu Talib, Muhammad ibn Ahmed al-Baghdadi), the minister of al-\nMusta’sim Billah, by holding that, moved by the general masses of the \nShi’as and the ruin of al-Karkh sector (of Baghdad), he invited Hulagu \nKhan through the latter’s minister, the great scholar Nasir’d-Din \nMuhammad ibn Muhammad at-Tusi, to march on Baghdad. Even if it be \nso, it is not possible to ignore the historical fact that before this the \nAbbasid Caliph an-Nasir Lidini’llah had initiated the move for the attack \non the Muslim areas. When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to \nacknowledge the authority of the Caliphate he had sent word to Chingiz \nKhan to march on Khwarazm, from which the Tartars had understood that \nthere was no unity and cooperation among the Muslims. Thereafter the \nHanafite had sent for Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi’ite as a consequence \nof which the Tartars secured control over Khurasan and prepared the way \nto march towards Baghdad. In these circumstances to hold only ibn al-\nAlqami responsible for the ruination of Baghdad and to ignore the move \nof an-Nasir Lidinillah and the dispute between the Hanafite and the \nShafi’ite will be covering up the facts, when in fact the cause for the ruin \nof Baghdad was this very conquest of Khurasan, whose real movers were \nthe Hanafite inhabitants of the place. It was by this conquest that Hulagu \nKhan had the courage to march on the center of Islam.; otherwise, it \ncannot have been the result of a single individual’s message that he \nassaulted an old capital like Baghdad, the awe of whose power and \ngrandeur was seated in the hearts of a large part of the world. \n \nTo know hidden things on a personal level is one thing, while to \nbe gifted by Allah with knowledge of any matter and to convey it to \nothers is different. The knowledge of the future which the prophets and \nvicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah’s teaching and \ninforming. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen in \nthe future. Of course, He passes this knowledge on to whoever He wills. \nThus He says the following: \n(He alone is) the One Who knows the unseen, neither does He \nreveal His secrets to any (one else) save to that one of the Messengers \nwhom He chooses. (Holy Quran, 72: 26-27) \n \nIn this way, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) also received knowledge \nof the future through the instructions of the Prophet (h) or inspiration \nfrom Allah, for which these words of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) stand \ntestimony. Of course, sometimes it is not proper or expedient to disclose \ncertain matters and they are allowed to remain under a veil. Then no one \ncan be acquainted with them as Allah says, \nVerily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour \nand He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs, and no \nsoul knows what it shall earn in the morrow, nor does any soul know in \nwhat land it shall die: Verily Allah is All-knowing, All-aware. (Holy \nQuran, 31: 34)"

    "text": "Delivered When Abu Dharr (l\\) Was Exiled to Rabadha:\nO Abu Dharr! You demonstrated your anger in the Name of \nAllah; therefore, have hope in Him for Whom you became angry. The \npeople were afraid of you in the matter of their (seeking the pleasure of \nthis) world while you feared them for your faith. Then leave to them that \nfor which they are afraid of you and get away from them taking away \nwhat you fear them about. How needy are they for what you dissuade \nthem from and how heedless are you towards what they are denying you. \nYou will shortly know who is the gainer tomorrow (on the Day of \nJudgement) and who is more enviable. Even if these skies and earth were \nclosed to some individual and he feared Allah, then Allah will open them \nfor him. Only rightfulness should attract you while wrongfulness should \ndetract you. If you had accepted their worldly attractions they will have \nloved you and if you had shared in it they will have given you asylum. \nAbu Dharr al-Ghifari’s name was Jundab ibn Junadah. He was an \ninhabitant of ar-Rabadha which was a small village on the east side of \nMedna. When he heard about the proclamation of the Prophet (h), he \ncame to Mecca and after making inquiries saw the Prophet (h) and \naccepted Islam whereupon the unbelievers of Quraish gave him all sorts \nof troubles and inflicted pain after pain, but he remained steadfast. \nAmong the acceptors of Islam he is the third, fourth or fifth. Along with \nthis precedence in Islam his renunciation and piety was so high that the \nProphet (h) said, “Among my people, Abu Dharr is the like `¦sa (Jesus) \nson of Maryam (Mary) in renunciation and piety.” \n \nDuring the reign of `Umar, Abu Dharr left for Syria, and during \nOthman’s reign, he also remained there. He spent his days in counseling, \npreaching, acquainting people with the greatness of the members of the \nProphet’s family and guiding the people to the rightful path. The traces of \nShi`ism now found in Syria and Jabal Amil (northern Lebanon) are the \nresult of his preaching and activity and the fruit of seeds sown by him. \nThe Governor of Syria, Mu`awiyah, did not like the conduct of Abu Dharr \nand was much disgusted with his open criticism and mention of the \nmoney-making and other wrongful activities of Othman. But he could do \nnothing. At last he wrote to Othman that if he remained there any longer \nhe will rouse the people against the Caliph. They should, therefore, be \nsome remedy against this. On this, Othman wrote to him that Abu Dharr \nshould be seated on an unsaddled camel and dispatched to Medina. The \norder was obeyed and Abu Dharr was sent to Medina. On reaching \nMedina he resumed his preaching of righteousness and truth. He will \nrecall to the people the days of the Holy Prophet (h) and refrain them \nfrom displays of extravagance, whereupon Othman was much perturbed \nand tried to restrict his freedom of speech. One day, he sent for him and \nsaid, “I have come to know that you go about propagating that the Holy \nProphet (h) said, “When Banu Umayyah become thirty in number, they \nwill regard the cities of Allah as their own property, His creatures as their \nslaves and His religion as the tool of their treachery.” \n \nAbu Dharr replied that he had heard the Prophet (h) say so. \nOthman said that he was speaking a lie. Othman inquired from those \nbeside him if any one of them had heard this tradition. They all replied in \nthe negative...! Abu Dharr then said that the same enquiry should be made \nfrom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). Ali (x) was sent for and asked about it. \nAli (x) said that it was correct and that Abu Dharr was telling the truth. \nOthman inquired on what basis he gave testimony for the correctness of \nthis tradition. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) replied that he himself had \nheard the Holy Prophet (h) say, “There is no speaker under the sky or \nover the earth more truthful than Abu Dharr.” \n \nNow Othman could do nothing. If he still held him to be liar it \nwill mean falsification of the Prophet (h). He, therefore, kept quiet \ndespite much perturbation, since he could not refute him. On the other \nside Abu Dharr began speaking against the usurping of Muslims’ property \nquite openly and whenever he saw Othman he will recite this verse:\n \nnd those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in Allah’s \nway; announce you unto them a painful chastisement. On the Day (of \nJudgement) when it shall be heated in the fire of hell, then shall be \nbranded with it their foreheads and their sides and their backs; (saying \nunto them) AThis is what you hoarded up for yourselves, taste you then \nwhat you did hoard u, p. (Holy Quran, 9: 34-35) \n \nOthman promised him money but could not entrap this free man \nin his golden net, then resorted to repression but could not stop his truth-\nspeaking tongue. At last he ordered him to leave and go to ar-Rabadha \nand deputed Marwan, son of the man (al-Hakam) exiled by the Prophet \n(h), to turn him out of Medina. At the same time he issued the inhumane \norder that no one should speak to him nor see him off. But Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x), Imam Hassan, Imam Hussain (x), Aqil ibn Abu Talib, \nAbdullah ibn Ja`far and Ammar ibn Yasir did not pay any heed to this \norder and accompanied him to see him off and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) uttered these sentences (i.e. the above sermon) on that occasion. \n \nIn Rabadha, Abu Dharr had to put up with a very hard life. It was \nhere that his son, Dharr, and his wife died and the sheep and goats that he \nwas keeping for his livelihood also died. Of his children, only one \ndaughter remained who equally shared his starvation and woes. When the \nmeans of subsistence were fully exhausted and day after day passed \nwithout food she said to Abu Dharr, “Father! How long shall we go on \nlike this? We should go somewhere in search of livelihood.”Abu Dharr \ntook her with him and set off for the wilderness. He could not find even \nfoliage to sustain themselves. At last, he was tired; he sat down \nsomewhere. Then he collected some sand and, putting his head on it, lay \ndown. Soon he began gasping, his eyes rolled up and the pangs of death \ngripped him. \nWhen the daughter saw this condition, she was perplexed and \nsaid, “Father! If you die in this vast wilderness, how shall I manage for \nyour burial all by myself?”He replied, “Do not get upset. The Prophet \n(h) told me that I shall die in helplessness and some Iraqis will arrange \nfor my burial. After my death, you must put a sheet over me then sit by \nthe roadway. When some caravan passes by, tell them that the Prophet’s \ncompanion Abu Dharr has died.”Consequently, after her father’s death, \nshe went and sat by the roadside. After some time, a caravan did, indeed, \npass by. It included Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakh`i, Hijr ibn \nAbdi at-Ta’i, Alqamah ibn Qays an-Nakh`i, Sa`sa`ah ibn Suhhan al-Abdi, \nal-Aswad ibn Yazid an-Nakh`i etc. who were all fourteen persons in \nnumber. When they heard about the passing away of Abu Dharr they were \nshocked at his helpless death. They stopped their riding beasts and \npostponed the onward journey for his burial. Malik al-Ashtar gave a sheet \nof cloth for his shroud. It was valued at four thousand Dirhams. After his \nfuneral rites and burial they departed. This happened in the month of \nDhul-Hijja, 32 A.H."

Certainly it is reality not fun, truth not falsehood. It is \nnone else than death. Its caller is making himself heard and its dragsman \nis making haste. The majority of the people should not deceive you. You \nhave seen those who lived before you, amassed wealth, feared poverty \nand felt safe from its (evil) consequences, the longevity of desires and the \n(apparent) distance from death. How, then, death overtook them, turned \nthem out of their homelands and took them out of their places of safety. \nThey were borne on coffins, people were busy about them one after \nanother, carrying them on their shoulders and supporting them with their \nhands.\n \nDid you not witness those who engaged in long-reaching desires, \nbuilt strong buildings, amassed much wealth but their houses turned to \ngraves and their collections turned into ruin. Their property devolved on \nthe successors and their spouses on those who came after them. They \ncannot (now) add to their good deeds nor invoke (Allah’s) mercy with \nregard to evil acts. Therefore, whoever makes his heart habituated to fear \nAllah achieves a forward status and his action is successful. Prepare \nyourself for it and do all that you can for Paradise. Certainly this world \nhas not been made a place of permanent stay for you. But it has been \ncreated as a pathway in order that you may take from it the provisions of \nyour (good) actions for the permanent house (in Paradise). Be ready for \ndeparture from here and keep close your riding animals for setting off."

    "text": "Delivered when Umar ibn al-Khattab consulted Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) about himself, taking part in the march towards Rome \n(Byzantine Empire) .\nAllah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the \nstrengthening of boundaries and hiding of the secret places. Allah helped \nthem when they were few and could not protect themselves. He is living \nand will not die. If you will yourself proceed towards the enemy and clash \nwith them and fall into some trouble, there will be no place of refuge for \nthe Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any place they will return \nto. Therefore, you should send there an experienced man and send with \nhim people of good performance who are well-intentioned. If Allah grants \nyou victory, then this is what you want. If it is otherwise, you will serve \nas a support for the people and a returning place for the Muslims. \n \nAbout Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), the strange status is adopted \nthat on the one hand, it is said that he was ignorant of practical politics \nand unacquainted with ways of administration from which it is intended \nthat the rebellions created by the Umayyad’s lust for power should be \nshown to be the outcome of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s weak \nadministration. On the other hand, much is made of the various occasion \nwhen the then Caliphs consulted Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in important \naffairs of State in the matter of wars with unbelievers. The aim in this is \nnot to exhibit his correctness of thinking and judgement of deep sagacity \nbut to show that there was unity and concord between him and the \nCaliphs so that attention should not be paid to the fact that in some \nmatters they also differed and that mutual clashes had also occurred. \nHistory shows that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) did have differences of \nprinciples with the Caliphs and did not approve every step of theirs. In the \nsermon of ash-Shaqshaqiyya he has expressed in loud words his \ndifference of opinion and anger about each regime. Nevertheless, this \ndifference does not mean that correct guidance should be withheld in \ncollective Islamic problems. Again, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s character \nwas so high that no one could imagine that he will ever evade giving \ncounsel which concerned the common wealth, or will give such counsel \nwhich will damage public interests. That is why, despite differences of \nprinciples, he was consulted. This throws light on the greatness of his \ncharacter and the correctness of his thinking and judgement. Similarly, it \nis a prominent trait of the Holy Prophet’s character that despite rejecting \nhis claim to Prophethood the unbelievers acknowledged him the best \ntrustee and could never doubt his trustworthiness. Rather, even during \nclashes of mutual opposition they entrusted to him their property without \nfear and never suspected that their property will be misappropriated. \nSimilarly, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was held to occupy so high a status \nof trust and confidence that friend and foe both trusted in the correctness \nof his counsel. So, just as the Prophet’s conduct shows his height of \ntrustworthiness and just as it cannot be inferred from it that there was \nmutual accord between him and the unbelievers because trust has its own \nplace while the clash of Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, \ndespite having differences with the Caliphs, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nwas regarded as the protector of national and community interests and as \nthe guardian of Islam’s well-being and prosperity. Thus when national \ninterests were involved he was consulted and he tendered his unbiased \nadvice raising himself above personal ends and keeping in view the \nProphet’s tradition to the effect that “He who is consulted is a trustee \nnever allowed any dishonesty or duplicity or interfere. When on the \noccasion of the battle of Palestine, the `Umar consulted him about his \ntaking part in it himself, then, irrespective of whether or not his opinion \nwill accord with `Omer’s feelings, he kept in view Islam’s prestige and \nexistence and counseled him to stay in his place and to send to the battle-\nfront such a man who should be experienced and well-versed in the are of \nfighting because the going of an inexperienced man will have damaged \nthe established prestige of Islam and the awe in which the Muslims were \nheld which had existed from the Prophet’s days will have vanished. In \nfact, in the Omer’s going there Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saw signs of \ndefeat and vanquishment. He, therefore, found Islam’s interest to lie in \ndetaining him and indicated his view in the words that:. \n \nIf you have to retreat from the battlefield, it will not be your \npersonal defeat only, but the Muslims will lose heart by it and leave the \nbattlefield and disperse here and there because with the officer in \ncommand leaving the field the army too will lose ground. Furthermore, \nwith the center being without the Caliph there will be no hope of any \nfurther assistance from behind which could sustain courage of the \ncombatants. \n \nThis is that counsel which is put forth as a proof of mutual \naccord, although this advice was tendered in view of Islam’s prestige and \nlife which was dearer to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) than any other \ninterest. No particular individual’s life was dear to him for which he \nmight have advised against participation in the battle."

He clashed with Mis’ab’s force at Maskin near Dayrul-\nJathaliq [Catholics’ Monastery] in the outskirts of Kufa. After defeating him he \nmade a victorious entry into Kufa and took allegiance from its inhabitants. Then \nhe sent al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi to Mecca to fight with Abdullah ibn az-\nZubayr. Consequently this man besieged Mecca and stoned it and shed the blood \nof thousands of innocent persons like water. He killed ibn az-Zubayr and hung \nhis body on the gallows. He perpetrated such atrocities on the people that one \nshudders at the thought of them. \nThose who do not commit sins and have been gifted with safety \n(from sins) should take pity on sinners and other disobedient people. \nGratitude should be mostly their indulgence and it should prevent them \nfrom (finding faults with) others. What about the backbiter who blames \nhis brother and finds fault with him? Does he not remember that Allah has \nconcealed the sins which he committed while they were bigger than his \nbrother’s sins pointed out by him? How can he vilify him about his sins \nwhen he has himself committed one like it? Even if he has not committed \na similar sin he must have committed bigger ones. By Allah, even if he \ndid not commit big sins but committed only small sins, his exposing the \nsins of people is itself a big sin. \n \nO servants of Allah! Do not be quick in exposition anyone’s sin \nfor he may be forgiven for it and do not feel yourself safe even for a small \nsin because you may be punished for it. Therefore, everyone of you who \ncomes to know the faults of others should not expose them in view of \nwhat he knows about his own faults and he should remain busy in thanks \nthat he has been saved from what others have been indulging in. \n \nThe habit of fault finding and backbiting has become so common \nthat even the feeling of its evilness has disappeared. And at present \nneither the high avoid it nor the low; neither the high status of the pulpit \nprevents it nor the sacredness of the mosque. Whenever a few \ncompanions sit together their topic of conversation and engaging interest \nis just to discuss the faults of their opponents with added color and to \nlisten to them attentively. Although the fault-finder is himself involved in \nthe faults which he picks up in others, yet he does not like that his own \nfaults should be exposed. In such a case, he should have consideration for \nsimilar feelings in others and should avoid searching for their faults and \nhurting their feelings. He should act after the proverb: “Do not do unto \nothers what you do not want others to do unto you. \n \nBackbiting is defined as the exposure of the fault of a brother-in-\nfaith with the intent to vilify him in such a way as to irritate him, whether \nit be by speaking, acting, implication or suggestion. Some people take \nbackbiting to cover only that which is false or contrary to fact. According \nto them to relate what was seen or heard, exactly as it was, is not \nbackbiting and they say that they are not backbiting but only relating \nexactly what they saw or heard. But in fact backbiting is the name of this \nvery relating of the facts because if it is not factually correct it will be \nfalse accusation and wrong blame. It is related about the Prophet (h) that \nhe said the following:. \nDo you know what backbiting is? People said, “Allah and His \nProphet (h) know better. Then he said, “Backbiting means that you say \nabout your brother a thing which pains him. Someone said, “But what if I \nsay what is actually true about him? the Prophet (h) replied, “It is \nbackbiting only when it is factually true; otherwise, you will be accusing \nhim falsely. \n \nThere are many causes for indulging in backbiting and because of \nthis a man commits it sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. \nAbu Hamid al-Ghazali has recounted these causes in detail in his book \nIhya’ Ulumud-Din. A few of the important ones are: \n1) \nTo make fun of anyone or to make him appear abased. \n2) \nTo make people laugh and to display one’s own jolliness and high \nspiritedness.\n3) \nExpressing one’s feelings under the influence of rage and anger. \n4) \nTo establish one’s feelings under the influence of rage and anger. \n5) \nTo disprove one’s connection or involvement in a matter; namely \nthat a particular evil was not committed by oneself but by \nsomeone else. \n6) \nTo associate oneself with some group when in their company in \norder to avoid strangeness with them. \n7) \nTo belittle a person from whom it is feared that he will expose \nsome fault of one’s. \n8) \nTo defeat a competitor in the same calling. \n9) \nTo seek status in the audience of someone in power. \n10) \nTo express sorrow by saying it is sad and so-and-so has fallen in \nsuch and such a sin. \n11) \nTo express astonishment, for example, to say it is wonderful that \nso and so has done this. \n12) \nTo name the committer of an act when expressing anger over it. \nHowever, in some cases fault finding or criticizing does not fall \nunder backbiting:. \n1) \nIf the oppressed complains of the oppressor in order to seek \nredress, it is not backbiting. Allah says about it:. \n \nAllah does not love open utterance of evil in speech except by \none who has been wronged(Holy Quran, 4: 148). \n2) \nTo relate anyone’s fault while giving advice is not backbiting \nbecause dishonesty and duplicity is not permissible in counseling. \n3) \nIf in connection with seeking the requirements of a religious \ncommandment the naming of a particular individual cannot be \navoided, then to state the fault of such person to the extent \nnecessary will not be backbiting. \n4) \nTo relate the misappropriation or dishonesty committed by \nsomeone with a view to saving a Muslim brother from harm will \nnot be backbiting. \n5) \nTo relate the fault of someone before one who can prevent him \nfrom committing it is not backbiting. \n \n6) Criticism and expression of opinion about a relater of traditions \nis not backbiting. \n7) \nIf a person is well acquainted with someone’s shortcoming, then \nto relate such a fault in order to define his personality, for \nexample, describing a deaf, dumb, lame or handless person as \nthus, is not backbiting. \n8) \nTo describe any fault of a patient before a physician for purposes \nof treatment is not backbiting. \n9) \nIf someone claims wrong lineage then to expose his correct \nlineage is not backbiting. \n10) \nIf the life, property or honor of someone can be protected only by \ninforming him of some fault, it will not be backbiting. \n11) \nIf two persons discuss a fault of another which is already known \nto both it will not be backbiting, although to avoid discussing it is \nbetter, since it is possible one of the two might have forgotten it. \n12) \nTo expose the evils of one who openly commits evils is not \nbackbiting as the tradition runs: “There is no backbiting in the \ncase one who has torn away the veil of shamefulness.”"

It is Allah’s religion which He has raised above all \nfaiths and His army which He has mobilized and extended, till it has \nreached the point where it stands now and has arrived its present \npositions. We hold a promise from Allah and He will fulfil His promise \nand support His army. \n \nThe status of the head of government is that of the thread for \nbeads, as it connects them and keeps them together. If the thread is \nbroken, they will disperse and be lost and will never come together again. \nThe Arabs today, even though small in number are big because of Islam \nand strong because of unity. You should remain like the axis for them and \nrotate the mill (of government) with (the help of) the Arabs and be their \nroot. Avoid battle because if you leave this place the Arabs will attack \nyou from all sides and directions till the unguarded places left behind by \nyou will become more important than those before you. \n \nIf the Persians see you tomorrow they will say, “He is the root \n(chief) of Arabia. If we do away with him we will be in peace. In this way \nthis will heighten their eagerness against you and their keenness to aim at \nyou. You say that they have set out to fight against the Muslims. Well, \nAllah detests their setting out more than you do and He is more capable of \npreventing what He detests. As regarding your idea about their (large) \nnumber, in the past we did not fight on the strength of large numbers but \nwe fought on the basis of Allah’s support and assistance.” \n \nWhen some people advised Umar to partake in the battle of \nQadisiyya or Nahawand, he found it against his personal inclination, so he \nthough it necessary to consult Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). This way, if \nthe Imam (x) advised him against it, he would plead to others to stay back \nbased on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s advice. But if the Imam (x) advised \nhim to participate in the battle, some other excuse would be found. \nHowever, unlike others, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) advised him to stay. \nOther people had advised him to join in fighting because the Holy Prophet \n(h) did not send only others to fight but took part in it himself as well, \nkeeping his close relations also with him. What Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) had in view was that Omer’s presence in the battle could not be \nbeneficial to Islam, but rather his staying back will save the Muslims from \ndispersion.\n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s view that Athe status of the head of \ngovernment is that of the axis around which the system of the government \nrotates is a point of principle and does not concern any particular \npersonality. whether the ruler is a Muslim or an unbeliever, just or \ndespotic, virtuous or vicious, for the administration of the state his \npresence is a necessity, as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has explained \nelsewhere at greater length:. \n \nThe fact is that there is no escape for men from a ruler, good or \nbad. Faithful persons perform (good) acts in his rule while the unfaithful \nenjoys (worldly) benefits in it. During the rule, Allah will carry \neverything to its end. Through the ruler tax is collected, the enemy is \nfought, roads are protected and the right of the weak is taken from the \nstrong till the virtuous enjoy peace and are allowed protection from (the \noppression of) the wicked.

There is no doubt that he held worldly authority, irrespective of the \nquestion of whether it was secured in the right way or wrong way. And \nwhere there is authority there is centering of people’s affairs. That is why \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said that if Umar will go out the Arabs will \nfollow him in large numbers towards the battlefield because when the \nruler is on the march the people will not like to stay behind. The result of \ntheir going will be that city after city will become vacant, while the \nenemy will infer from their reaching the battlefield that the Islamic cities \nare lying vacant and that if these people were repulsed no assistance will \nreach the Muslims from the center. Again, if the ruler were killed the \narmy will disperse automatically because the ruler is as its foundation. \nWhen the foundation is shaken the walls cannot remain standing. The \nword Aslul-Arab (the root chief) of Arabia has not been used by Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) as his own but he has taken it from the Persians. \nObviously in his capacity as the head of the State, Umar was, in their \nview, the chief of Arabia. Besides, the reference is to the country, not to \nIslam or Muslims, so that there is no suggestion of any importance for \nhim from the Islamic point of view. \n \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) pointed out to Umar that on \nhis reaching there the Persians will aim at him and that if he fell into their \nhands they will not spare him without killing, although such words will \nhave touched the brave to the quick and will have heightened their spirits, \n`Umar liked the advice to stay back and thought it better to keep himself \naway from the flames of battle. If this advice had not been in accord with \nhis personal inclination he will not have received it so heartily and will \nhave tried to argue that the administration of the country could be \nmaintained by leaving a deputy. Again when other people had already \nadvised him to go out, what was the need for consulting Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) except to get an excuse to stay back."

Because He the Glorified One, \nrevealed Himself to them through His Book without their having seen \nHim, by means of what He showed them out of His might and made them \nfear His sway.

For the people of this period nothing will be more \nvalueless than the Holy Quran being recited as it ought to be recited, nor \nanything more valuable than the Holy Quran being misplaced from its \nstatus.

In these days the Holy Quran and its people \nwill be exiled and expelled. They will be companions keeping together on \none path, but no one will offer them asylum. Consequently at this time the \nHoly Quran and its people will be among the people but not among them, \nwill be with them but not with them because misguidance cannot accord \nwith guidance even though they may be together. The people will have \nunited on division and will, therefore, have cut away from the community, \nas though they were the leaders of the Holy Quran and not the Holy \nQuran their leader. Nothing of it will be left with them except its name \nand they will know nothing save its writing and its words. Before that, \nthey will inflict hardships on the virtuous, naming the latter’s truthful \nviews about Allah false allegations and enforcing for virtues the \npunishment of the vice. \n \nThose before you passed away because of the lengthening of their \ndesires and the forgetting of their death, till that promised event befell \nthem about which excuses are turned down, repentance is denied and \npunishment and retribution is inflicted. \nAbout Ahl al-Bayt (x)\nO people! He who seeks counsel from Allah secures guidance and \nhe who adopts His word as guide is led towards what is more straight \nbecause Allah’s lover feels secure and His opponent feels afraid. It does \nnot behoove one who knows His greatness to assume greatness, but the \ngreatness of those who know His greatness is that they should know \nbefore Him and the safety for those who know what His power is lies in \nsubmitting to Him. Do not be scared away from the truth like the scaring \nof the healthy from the scabbed person, or the sound person from the sick. \n \nYou should know that you will never know guidance unless you \nknow who has abandoned it, you will never abide by the pledges of the \nHoly Quran unless you know who has broken them and will never cling \nto it unless you know who has forsaken it. Seek these things from those \nwho own them because they are the life spring of knowledge and death of \nignorance. They are the people whose commands will disclose to you \ntheir (extent of) knowledge, their silence will disclose their (capacity of) \nspeaking and their outer appearance will disclose their inner self.

As the time passes the objective of death approaches near, so \nmuch as that in one’s attempt to seek life one meets death. \n169Awa khalakum dhammun (No evil will come to you). This sentence \nis used as a proverb. It was first employed by Qasir, slave of Khazimah ibn \nMalik al-Abrash. \n170The intention is that when all these things die, how can those who \ninhabit them remain safe? Certainly they too, like everything else, have to pass \naway some day or other. Then why should there be any wonder at my life \ncoming to an end? \nThey took to the right and the left piercing through to the ways of \nevil and leaving the paths of guidance. Do not make haste for a matter \nwhich is to happen and is awaited and do not wish for delay in what the \nmorrow is to bring for you. For, how many people make haste for a \nmatter, but when they get it they begin to wish they had not got it. How \nnear is today to the dawning of tomorrow. O my people, this is the time \nfor the occurrence of every promised event and the approach of things \nwhich you do not know.

Then a group of people will be sharpened like the \nsharpening of swords by the blacksmith.

The virtuous did not show any obligation to Allah \nbut calmly endured and did not feel elated for having engaged themselves \nin truthfulness. Eventually the period of trial came to an end according to \nwhat was ordained. Then they propagated their good views among others \nand sought nearness to Allah according to the command of their leader. \n \nWhen Allah took the Prophet (h) (to himself) a group of men \nwent back on their tracks.

He is Distinct \nfrom things because He overpowers them and exercises might over them, \nwhile things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to Him \nand their turning towards Him. \nHe who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers \nHim. He who numbers Him rejects His eternity. He who asks “How?” \nseeks a description for Him. He who asks “Where?” limits Him. He is the \nOne Who knows everything. He is the Sustainer even though there be \nnothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful One even though there is \nnothing to be overpowered. \nPart of the same sermon about the Divine leaders (Imams)\nThe riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the what appears \nhas appeared and the curved has been straightened. Allah has replaced \none people with another and one day with another. We awaited these \nchanges as the famine-stricken await the rain. Certainly the Imams are the \nvicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know \nAllah. No one will enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows \nHim and no one will enter Hell except he who denies them and denies \nHim. \n \nAllah, the most Glorified One, has distinguished you with Islam \nand has chosen you for it. This is so because it is the name of safety and \nthe collection of honor. Allah, the most Glorified One, chose its way and \ndisclosed its pleas through open knowledge and secret maxims. Its (Holy \nQuran) wonders are not exhausted and its delicacies do not end. It \ncontains blossoming bounties and lamps of darkness. (The doors of) \nvirtues cannot be opened save with its keys, nor can gloom be dispelled \nsave with its lamps. Allah has protected its inaccessible points (from \nenemies) and allowed grazing (to its followers) in its pastures. It contains \ncover (from the ailment of misguidance) for the seeker of cure and full \nsupport for the seeker of support. \n \nThe first part of this sermon consists of important issues \nconcerning the science of knowledge about Allah, wherein Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) has thrown light on the matter that Allah is forever and His \nattributes are the same as He Himself. When we cast a glance at creation, \nwe see that for every movement there is a mover, from which every man \nof ordinary wisdom is compelled to conclude that no effect can appear \nwithout a cause, so much so, that even an infant a few days old, when his \nbody is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that someone has \ntouched him. He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning and looking. \nHow then can the creation of the world and the system of all creation be \narranged without a Creator or Organizer? Once it is necessary to believe \nin a Creator, then He should exist by Himself because everything which \nhas a beginning must have a center of existence from which it should \nterminate. If that too needed a creator, there will be the question of \nwhether this creator is also the creation of some other creator or exists by \nitself. Thus unless a Self-created Creator is believed in, who should be the \ncause of all causes, the mind will remain groping in the unending \nlabyrinth of cause and effect and never attain the idea of the last extremity \nof the series of creation. It will fall into the fallacy of circular arguing and \nwill not reach any end. If the creator were taken to have created himself, \nthen there will be (one of the two positions, namely) either he should be \nnon-existent or existent. If he were not existent, then it will not be \npossible for something non-existent to create any existent being. If he \nwere existent before creating himself, there will be no sense in coming \ninto being again, therefore, it is necessary to believe that the Creator \nshould be a Being not dependent on any other creator for His own \nexistence and everything else should be dependent on Him. This \ndependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the \nSource of all creation is from ever and eternal. And since all beings other \nthan He are subject to change, are dependent on status and place and are \nsimilar to one another in qualities and properties and since similarity leads \nto plurality whereas unity has no like save itself, therefore, nothing can be \nlike Him. Even things called one cannot be reckoned after His Unity \nbecause He is One and Singular in every respect. He is free and pure from \nall those attributes which are found in body or matter because He is \nneither body, nor color, nor shape, nor does He lie in any direction, nor is \nHe bounded within some place or locality. Therefore, man cannot see or \nunderstand Him through his senses or feelings because senses can know \nonly those things which accord with the limitations of time, place and \nmatter. To believe that He can be seen is to believe that He has body, but \nsince He is not a body and He does not exist through a body and He does \nnot lie in any direction or place, there is no question of His being seen. \nBut His being unseen is not like that of subtle material bodies, due to \nwhose delicacy the eye pierces through them and eyes remain unable to \nsee them; as for example the wind in the vast firmament. But He is the \nunseen by His very existence. Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for Him. \nHe sees as well as hears, but is not dependent on instruments of seeing or \nhearing because if He were in need of organs of the body for hearing and \nseeing He will be in need of external things for His perfection and will not \nbe a perfect Being, whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no \nattribute of perfection should be apart from His Self. To believe in \nattributes separately from His Self will mean that there will be a self and a \nfew attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes will be \nAllah. But a thing which is compounded is dependent on its parts and \nthese parts must exist before their composition into the whole. When the \nparts exist from before, how can the whole be from ever and eternal \nbecause its existence is later than that of its parts. But Allah had the \nattributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was \nexistent because none of His attributes were created in Him from outside, \nbut His attributes are His Self and His Self is His attributes. \nConsequently, His knowledge does not depend on the object of \nknowledge existing first then His knowledge because His Self is prior to \nthings coming into existence. Nor is it necessary for His power that there \nshould first exist the object to be over-powered then alone He will be \ncalled Powerful because Powerful is that who has power equally for doing \nor abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be over-powered \nis not necessary. Similarly Sustainer means master. Just as He is the \nmaster of thenon-existent after its coming into existence, in the same way \nHe has power to bring it into existence from non-existence, namely if He \nso wills He may bestow existence upon it."

No one will \nwarn you like him who knows. \n \nOne of the firm decisions of Allah in the Wise Reminder (Holy \nQuran) upon which He bestows reward or gives punishment and through \nwhich He likes or dislikes is that it will not benefit a man, even though he \nexerts himself and acts sincerely if he leaves this world to meet Allah \nwith one of these acts without repenting, namely that he believed in a \npartner with Allah during his obligatory worship, or appeased his own \nanger by killing an individual, or spoke about acts committed by others, \nor sought fulfillment of his needs from people by introducing an \ninnovation in his religion, or met people with a double face, or moved \namong them with a double tongue. Understand this because an illustration \nis a guide for its like. \n \nBeasts are concerned with their bellies. Carnivores are concerned \nwith assaulting others. Women are concerned with the adornments of this \nignoble life and the creation of mischief herein.172 \nIbn Abul-Hadid \n \n171The word Ummi has been used in the Holy Quran with reference to \nthe Holy Prophet (h) in 7: 157-158. For better understanding of the word, refer \nto the books of commentary on the Holy Quran. \n172The intention is to say that the cause of all mischief and evil is the \npassion to satisfy bodily needs and the passion to subdue. If a human being is \nsubjugated by the passion to satisfy bodily needs and considers filling the \nstomach as his aim there will be no difference between him and a beast because \na beast too has no aim except to fill its belly. But if he is over-powered by the \npassion to subdue others and takes to killing and devastation there will be no \ndifference between him and a carnivorous beast because the latter’s aim is also \ntearing and devouring. If both the passions are at work in him then he is like a \nwoman because in a woman both these passions act side by side and because of \nthis she is extremely eager of adornment and is active in fanning mischief and \ndisturbance. However, a true believer will never agree to adopt these habits as \nhis mode of behavior, rather he keeps his passions suppressed so that he neither \nallows pride and vanity to approach near him nor does he fan mischief or \ndisturbance for fear of Allah. \nhas written that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) delivered this sermon at the \ntime of marching towards Basra and since the trouble of Basra was the \nresult of a woman’s instigation. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has, after \nmentioning beasts and carnivore, held a woman also to possess such \nqualities. Thus the battle of Basra was the result of these qualities, \nwhereby thousands of persons were involved in death and destruction. \n (On the other hand) believers are humble, believers are \nadmonishers and believers are afraid (of Allah)."

The shepherd has \ntended (his flocks). So respond to the caller and follow the shepherd. \n \nThose who oppose have entered the oceans of disturbance and \nhave taken to innovations instead of the Sunnah (the Prophet’s holy \ndeeds, utterances and his unspoken approvals), while the believers have \nsunk down and the misguided and the liars are speaking. We are the near \nones, companions, treasure holders and doors (to the Sunnah). Houses are \nnot entered save through their doors. Whoever enters them from other \nthan the door is called a thief. \nPart of the same sermon: \n \nThe delights of the Holy Quran are about them (Ahl al-Bayt [x], \ndescendants of the Prophet [h]). They are the treasurers of Allah. When \nthey speak, they tell the truth, but when they keep quiet, no one can speak \nunless they speak. The forerunner should report correctly to his people, \nshould retain his wits and should be one of the children (a man) of the \nnext world because he has come from there and will return to it. \n \nThe beginning of the action of one who sees with the heart and \nacts with the eyes is to assess whether the action will go against him or \nfor him. If it is for him he indulges in it, but if it is against him he keeps \naway from it. For, he who acts without knowledge is like one who treads \nwithout a path. Then his deviation from the path keeps him at a distance \nfrom his aim. And he who acts according to knowledge is like he who \ntreads the clear path. Therefore, he who can see should see whether he \nshould proceed or return. \n \nYou should also know that the outside (of everything) has a \nsimilar inside. Of whatever the outside is good, its inside too is good and \nwhatever the outside is bad, its inside too is bad. The truthful Prophet (k)\nhas said that: “Allah may love a man but hate his action and may love the \naction but hate the man. You should also know that every action is like \nvegetation and vegetation cannot do without water while waters are \ndifferent. So where the water is good the plant is good and its fruits are \nsweet, whereas where the water is bad, the plant will also be bad and its \nfruits will be bitter."

He is Allah, the True, the manifester of Truth. He \nis more True and more Manifest than eyes can see. Intellects cannot \ncomprehend Him by fixing limits for Him since in that case to Him will \nbe to attribute shape. Imagination cannot catch Him by fixing quantities \nfor Him for in that case to Him will be attributed body. He created \ncreatures without any example and without the advice of a counsel, or the \nassistance of a helper. His creation was completed by His command and \nbowed to His obedience. It responded (to Him) and did not defy (Him). It \nobeyed and did not resist. \n \nAn example of His delicate production, wonderful creation and \ndeep sagacity which He has shown us is found in these bats which keep \nhidden in the daylight although daylight reveals everything else and are \nmobile in thenight although thenight shuts up every other living being, \nand how their eyes get dazzled and cannot make use of the light of the sun \nso as to be guided in their movements and so as to reach their known \nplaces through the direction provided by the sun. \n \nAllah has prevented them from moving in the brightness of the \nsun and confined them to their places of hiding instead of going out at the \ntime of its shining. Consequently they keep their eyelids down in the day \nand treat night as a lamp and go with its help in search of their livelihood. \nThe darkness of night does not obstruct their sight nor does the gloom of \ndarkness prevent them from movement. As soon as the sun removes its \nveil and the light of morning appears and the rays of its light enter upon \nthe lizards in their holes, the bats pull down their eyelids on their eyes and \nlive on what they had collected in the darkness of thenight. Glorified is \nHe who has made thenight as day for them to seek livelihood and made \nthe day for rest and stay. \n \nHe has given them wings of flesh with which, at the time of need, \nthey rise upwards for flying. They look like the ends of ears without \nfeathers or bones. Of course, you can see the veins quite distinctly. They \nhave two wings which are neither too thin so that get turned in flying, nor \ntoo thick so that they prove heavy. When they fly their young ones hold \non to them and seek refuge with them, getting down when they get down \nand rising up when they rise. The young does not leave them till its limbs \nbecome strong, its wings can support it for rising and it begins to \nrecognize its places of living and its interest.

If you follow me I shall certainly carry you, if Allah so wills, on \nthe path of Paradise, even though it may be full of severe hardship and of \nbitter taste. \n \nAs regarding a certain woman, she is in the grip of womanly \nviews and malice is boiling in her bosom like the furnace of the \nblacksmith. If she were called upon to deal with others as she is dealing \nwith me she will not have done it. (As for me), even hereafter she will be \nallowed her original respect, while the reckoning (of her misdeeds) is an \nobligation of Allah. \nPart of the same sermon: \nThis path is the lightest course and the brightest lamp. Guidance \ntowards virtuous actions is sought through faith while guidance towards \nfaith is achieved through virtuous actions. Knowledge is made to prosper \nthrough faith and death is feared because of knowledge. This world comes \nto an end with death, while the next world is secured (by virtuous actions) \nin this world. For people there is no escape from resurrection. They are \nheading for this last end in its appointed course. \nPart of the same sermon: \nThey have got up from the resting places in their graves and have \nset off for the final objectives. Every house has its own people. They are \nnot changed nor shifted from the re. Commanding for good and refraining \nfrom evil are two characteristics of Allah, the Glorified. They can neither \nbring death near nor lessen sustenance. \n \nYou should adhere to the Book of Allah because it is the strong \nrope, a clear light, a benefiting cure, a quenching for thirst, protection for \nthe adherent and deliverance for the attached. It does not curve so as to \nneed straightening and does not deflect so as to be corrected. Frequency \nof its repetition and its falling on ears does not make it old. Whoever \nspeaks according to it, speaks truth and whoever acts by it is forward (in \naction).\n \nA man stood up and said the following: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x)! Tell us about this disturbance and whether you inquired about it \nfrom the Holy Prophet (h).” Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nsaid the following:\n \nWhen Allah, the Glorified sent down the verse: “Aleef laam \nmeem (A.L.M.) What?! Do people imagine that they will be let off on \n(their) saying: ‘We believe!’ and they will not be tried?!” (Holy Quran, \n29: 1-2), I came to know that the disturbance will not befall us so long as \nthe Prophet (k) is among us. So I said, “O Prophet of Allah (k)! What is \nthis disturbance of which Allah, the Sublime, has informed you?” He \nreplied, “O Ali! My people will create trouble after me.” I said, “O \nProphet of Allah (k)! On the day of Uhud, when people had fallen \nmartyrs and I was not among them, and this had been very much \nannoying me, did you not say to me, `Cheer up, for martyrdom is yours \nlater on’?” The Prophet (h) replied, “Yes it is so, but what about you \nenduring the present?” I said, “O Prophet of Allah (k)! This is not an \noccasion for endurance, but rather an occasion for cheering up and \ngratitude.” Then he said the following: “O Ali (x)! People will fall into \nmischief through their wealth, will show obligation to Allah on account of \ntheir faith, will expect His mercy, will feel safe from His anger and regard \nHis unlawful matters as lawful by raising false doubts and by their \nmisguiding desires. They will then hold lawful (the use of) wine by \ncalling it barley water, a bribe by calling it a gift and taking of usurious \ninterest by calling it sale.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah (k)! How should I \ndeal with them at the time, whether to hold them to have gone back in \nheresy or just in rebellion?” He said, “In rebellion.” \n \nThere is no denying the fact that Aisha’s behavior towards Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) was throughout inimical and very often her heart’s \nturbidity expressed itself on her face and her hatred and dislike became \nquite apparent, so much so that if in connection with some affair Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib’s name came up a frown appeared on her forehead and \nshe did not relish pronouncing it with her tongue. For example, when \nUbaydullah ibn `Abdillah ibn `Utbah mentioned to Abdullah ibn Abbas \nthenarration by Aisha namely that Ain his death-illness the Prophet (h),\ntaking support on al-Fadl ibn Abbas and another person, came to her \n(Aisha’s) house, Abdullah ibn Abbas said the following: “Do you know \nwho this Other man’ was?” He said, “No.” Then he said, “Ali (x) ibn Abu \nTalib, but she is averse to name him in a good context” (Ahmed ibn \nHanbal Al-Musnad, Vol. 6, pp. 34, 228; Ibn Sa`d, Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, \nVol. 2, part 2, p. 29 al-Tabari, Tarikh, Vol. 1, pp. 1800-1801. Al-\nBaladhiri, Ansab al-Ashraf, Vol. 1, pp. 544-545; al-Bayhaqi, Al-Sunan al-\nKubra, Vol. 3, p. 396). \n \nOne cause for this hatred and malice was the presence of Hadrat \nFatima (x) whose wholesome dignity and esteem pricked her heart like a \nthorn. Her jealousy towards the other wives (of the Prophet (h)) did not \nallow her to let the Prophet (h) love the daughter of his other wife to \nsuch a degree that he should stand on her approach, seat her in his own \nplace, declare her most honorable of all the women of the world and bear \nsuch love towards her children as to call them his own sons. All these \nthings pained her much and naturally her feelings on such an occasion \nwere that if she had borne children they will have been the Prophet’s sons \nand they will have been the pivot of the Prophet’s affection instead of \nImam Hassan and Imam Hussain. But she was not gifted with any issue \nand she gratified her own desire to be a mother by adopting the surname \nof Umm Abdillah (mother of the slave of Allah) after her sister’s son. In \nshort all these things created the passion of hatred in her heart, as a result \nof which she off and on complained to the Prophet (h) against Fatima (x)\nbut could not succeed in diverting the Prophet’s attention from her. News \nabout this mortification and estrangement also reached the ears of Abu \nBakr. That will only perturb him as he too could do nothing, except that \nhis verbal sympathies were with his daughter. At last the Prophet (h) left \nthis world and the reins of Government fell into Abu Bakr’s hands. Now \nwas the opportunity for him to avenge as best as he could and to \nperpetrate whatever violence he had in mind. Consequently, the first step \nhe took was that, in order to deprive Fatima (x) of inheritance, he denied \nthe principle of inheritance in the case of the prophets and held that \nneither do the prophets inherit nor are they inherited, but the property left \nby them belongs to the State. Fatima (x) was so affected that she gave up \nspeaking to him and passed away from this world with these very \nfeelings. Aisha did not even take the trouble to express any sorrow at her \ntragic death. Thus ibn Abul-Hadid has written. \n \nWhen Fatima (x) expired all the wives of the Prophet (h) came \nto Banu Hashim in condolence except Aisha. She did not come and \nshowed herself sick and words from her reached Ali which displayed her \njoy. (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, p. 198, Vol. 9). \n \nAs long as she bore so much malice against Fatima (x), how \ncould Fatima’s spouse be spared similar enmity and malice. Particularly \nwhen such events also occurred which worked like a fan and roused her \nfeeling of hatred, such as the incident of ifk when Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) said to the Prophet (h): “She is no better than the buckles of \nyour shoe, leave her and divorce her. On hearing this Aisha must have felt \nmiserable in her bed and must have developed the severest feeling of \nhatred against him. There were also moments when distinction was \nconferred on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in preference to Abu Bakr. For \ninstance, in connection with the dispatch of the Quranic verses on Bara’ah \n(innocence), the Prophet (h) removed Abu Bakr from the job, recalled \nhim and assigned it to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saying that he had \nbeen commanded by Allah to take it himself or send it through a member \nof his family. Similarly the Prophet (h) closed all the doors opening into \nthe mosque including that of Abu Bakr but allowed the door of Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib’s house to continue to open. \n \nAisha could not relish Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s distinction over \nher father and whenever there was any occasion for such distinction she \ndid her best to undo it. When in his last days the Prophet (h) ordered the \ncontingent under Usamah ibn Zayd to march and ordered Abu Bakr and \nUmar also to go under his command, they received a message from the \nwives of the Prophet (h) that his condition was serious and, therefore, \nthe contingent should come back instead of proceeding further. This was \nbecause their far-reaching sight had realized that their only purpose in \ngetting Medina vacated by the Muhajirun and the Ansar could be that \nafter the death of the Prophet (h) no one should stand in Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib’s way and that he should get the caliphate without any trouble. \nOn receipt of this message the contingent under Usamah came back. \nWhen the Prophet (h) learned this he again ordered Usamah to march \nwith the contingent and even said, “Allah may curse him who keeps away \nfrom the contingent, whereupon they again set off, but they were again \ncalled back till the Prophet’s illness assumed serious proportions, but \nUsamah’s contingent did not go out as it did not want to. After this Abu \nBakr was sent word through Bilal that he should deputize the Prophet (h)\nin leading the prayers in order to pave the way for his Caliphate. \nAccordingly keeping this in view he was first shown as the Prophet’s \ncaliph (deputy) in prayers and eventually was accepted as his caliph for \nall purposes. Thereafter matters were so contrived that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) could not get the Caliphate. However, after the reign of the third \ncaliph circumstances took such a turn that people were obliged to swear \nthe oath of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s hand. On this occasion \nAisha was present in Mecca. When she learned about Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib’s caliphate her eyes began emitting flames and rage and anger \nperturbed her mind and her hatred for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nassumed such seriousness that she rose against him on the excuse of \navenging blood of the same man (Othman) whom she had herself \nproclaimed fit to be killed and openly declared war as a result of which so \nmuch bloodshed occurred that the whole land of Basra was smeared with \nthe blood of those killed and the door of disunity was opened for good, \naccording to Sharh, Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 9, pp. 190-200."

It is as though you are attached to the last day which is driving \nyou as rapidly as are driven the she-camels which are dry for seven \nmonths. He who busies himself with things other than improvement of his \nown self becomes perplexed in darkness and entangled in ruination. His \nevil spirits immerse him deep in vices and make his bad actions appear \nhandsome. Paradise is the end of those who are forward (in good deeds) \nand Hell is the end of those who commit excesses. \n \nKnow O servants of Allah! that piety is a strong house of \nprotection while impiety is a weak house which does not protect its \npeople and does not give security to him who takes refuge the rein. Be \ninformed that the sting of sins is cut by piety and the final aim is achieved \nby conviction of belief. \n \nO servants of Allah! (fear) Allah, (fear) Allah, in the matter of \nyour own selves, which are the most beloved and dear to you because \nAllah has clarified to you the way of truthfulness and has lit its paths. So \n(you may choose) either ever-present misfortune or eternal happiness. \nYou should, therefore, provide in these mortal days for the eternal days. \nYou have been informed of the provision, ordered to march and told to \nmake haste in setting off. You are like staying riders who do not know \nwhen they will be ordered to march on. Beware, what will he, who has \nbeen created for the next world, do with this world? What will a person \ndo with wealth which he will shortly be deprived of while only its ill \neffects and reckoning will be left behind for him? \n \nO servants of Allah! the good which Allah has promised should \nnot be abandoned and the evil from which He has refrained should not be \ncoveted. O servants of Allah! fear the day when actions will be reckoned; \nthere will be much quaking and even children will get old. \n \nBe informed, O servants of Allah! that your own self is a guard \nover you; limbs are watchmen and truthful vigil-keepers who preserve \n(the record of) your actions and the numbers of your breaths. The gloom \nof the dark night cannot conceal you from them, nor can closed doors hide \nyou from them. Surely tomorrow is close to today. \n \nToday will depart with all that is has and tomorrow will come in \nits wake. It is as though everyone of you has reached that place on earth \nwhere he will be alone, namely the location of his grave. So, what to say \nof the lonely house, the solitary place of staying and the solitary exile. It \nis as though the cry(of the Horn) has reached you, the Hour has overtaken \nyou and you have come out (of your graves) for the passing of judgement. \n(The curtains of) falsehood have been removed from you and your \nexcuses have become weak. The truth about you has been proved. All \nyour matters have proceeded to their consequences. Therefore, you should \n(now) take counsel from examples, learn lessons from vicissitudes and \ntake advantage of those who warn. \nAbout the Holy Prophet (h) and the Holy Quran \nAllah deputed the Prophet (h) at a time when there had been no \nprophets for some time. People had been in slumber for a long time and \nthe twist of the rope had loosened. The Prophet (h) came with (a Book \ncontaining) testimonials to what (Vols.) were already there and also with \na light to be followed. It is the Holy Quran. If you ask it to speak it wo not \ndo so; but I will tell you about it. Be informed that it contains knowledge \nof what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and \nregulation for whatever faces you. \nPart of the same sermon: Autocracy of the Umayyads \nAt that time, there will remain no house nor tent but oppressors \nwill inflict it with grief and inject sickness in it. On that day, no one in the \nsky will listen to their excuse, and no one on the earth will come to their \nhelp. You selected for the government (caliphate) one who is not fit for it, \nand you raised him to a status which was not meant for him. Soon Allah \nwill take revenge against everyone who has oppressed. They will be given \nfood for food and drink for drink: colocynth for eating, myrrh and aloes \nfor drinking, and fear for an inner and the sword for an outer covering. \n \nThey are nothing but beasts of burden laden carrying sins and like \ncamels laden with evil loads of deeds. I swear, and again swear, that the \nUmayyads will have to spit out the caliphate as phlegm is spat and, \nthereafter, they will never taste it nor relish its flavor so long as day and \nnight rotate."

    "text": "Praise of Allah\nAllah’s verdict is judicious and full of wisdom. His Pleasure \nimplies protection and mercy. He decides with knowledge and forgives \nwith forbearance. \n \nO Lord! Praise to You for what You take and give, and for that \nfrom which You cure or with which You afflict. I praise You in away \nwhich is the most acceptable to You, the most liked by You and the most \ndignified before You, praise which fills all Your creation and reaches \nwhere You desires, praise which is not veiled from You and does not end \nand whose continuity does not cease. \nGreatness of Allah\nWe do not know the reality of Your greatness except that we \nknow that you are Ever-living and Self-subsisting, the One by Whom all \nthings subsist. Drowsiness or sleep do not overtake You; vision does not \nreach You and sight does not grasp You. You see the eyes and counts the \nages. You hold (people as slaves) by their forelocks and feet. We see \nYour creation and contemplate on it because of Your might and describe \nit as (a result of) Your great authority, whereas what is hidden from us, of \nwhich our sight has fallen short, which our intelligence has not attained \nand between which and ourselves curtains of the unknown have been cast, \nis far greater. \n \nHe who frees his heart (from all other engagements) and exerts \nhis thinking in order to know how You established Your throne, how You \ncreated Your creatures, how You suspended the air in Your skies and how \nYou spread Your earth on the waves of water... his eyes will return tired, \nhis intelligence defeated, his ears eager and his thinking wandering. \nPart of the Same Sermon about Hope and Fear in Allah\nOne claims, according to his own thinking, that he sets his hopes \non Allah. By Allah, the Great One, he speaks a lie. His status is that his \nhope (in Allah) does not appear through his action, although the hope of \neveryone who hopes is known through his own action. Every hope is so, \nexcept the hope in Allah, the Sublime, if it is impure. Every fear is \nestablished except the fear for Allah, if it is unreal. \n \nHe hopes big things from Allah and small things from men, but \nhe gives to man (such consideration as) he does not give to Allah. What \ndoes he think is the matter with Allah, glorified be His praise?! He is \naccorded less (consideration) than what is accorded to His creatures. Do \nyou ever fear to be false in your hope in Allah? Or do you not regard Him \nas the center of your hope? Similarly, if a man fears another man, he gives \nhim (such consideration) out of his fear which he does not give to Allah. \nThus, he has made his fear for men ready currency, while his fear of the \nCreator is mere deferment or promise. This is the case of everyone in \nwhose eye this world appears big (and important) and in whose heart its \nstatus is great. He prefers it over Allah, so he inclines towards it and \nbecomes its devotee. \nThe Example of the Holy Prophet (h)\nCertainly in the Prophet of Allah (h) was a perfect example for \nyou and a proof concerning the vices of this world, its defects, \nthemultitude of its disgraces and evils. Because its sides had been \nconstrained for him, while its flanks had been spread for others, he was \ndeprived of its milk and turned away from its adornments. \nThe Example of Musa (Moses) \nIf you want, I will, as a second example, relate to you concerning \nMusa, the Interlocutor of Allah (x), when he said, “O Allah! I am in need \nof whatever good You may grant me” (Holy Quran, 28: 24). By Allah, he \nasked Him only for bread to eat because he was used to eating the herbs \nof the earth, so much so that the greenness of the herbs could be seen \nfrom the delicate skin of his belly due to his thinness and the paucity of \nhis flesh. \nThe Example of Dawud (David) \nIf you desire, I can give you a third example of Dawud (x). He is \nthe holder of the Psalms and the reciter among the people of Paradise. He \nused to prepare baskets of palm-tree leaves with his own hands and would \nsay to his companions: “Which of you will help me by purchasing it?” He \nused to eat barley bread (bought) out of its prices. \nThe Example of Aisha (Jesus) \nIf you desire, I will tell you about Aisha (x) son of Maryam \n(Mary). He used a stone for his pillow, put on coarse clothes and ate \nrough food. His condiment was hunger. His lamp at night was the moon. \nHis shade during the winter was just the expanse of earth eastward and \nwestward. His fruits and flowers were only what grows out of the earth \nfor the cattle. He had no wife to allure him, nor any son to grieve him, nor \nwealth to deviate (his attention), nor greed to disgrace him. His two feet \nwere his conveyance and his two hands his servant. \nFollowing the Example of the Holy Prophet (h)\n \nYou should follow your Prophet (h), the pure, the chaste, Allah \nbless him and his descendants. He is the role model for his follower and \nthe consolation for the seeker of consolation. The most beloved person \nbefore Allah is he who follows His Prophet (h) and who treads in his \nfootsteps. He took the least (share) from this world and even then did not \ntake a full glance at it. Of all the people of the world he was the least \nsatiated and the most empty of stomach. The world was offered to him but \nhe refused to accept it. When he knew that Allah, the Glorified One, hated \na thing, he, too, hated it. When he knew that Allah regarded a thing as \nlow, he, too, regarded it as low. When he knew that Allah regarded a \nthing as small, he too regarded it as small. If we love what Allah and His \nProphet (h) hate and deem as great what Allah and His prophet hold as \nsmall, that by itself will be enough to isolate us from Allah and a \ntransgression against His Commands. \n \nThe Prophet (h) used to eat on the ground and sit like a slave. He \nrepaired his shoe with his hand and likewise patched his clothes. He \nwould ride an unsaddled ass and seat someone behind him. If there was a \ncurtain on his door with pictures on it, he would say to one of his wives, \n“Take it away out of my sight because if I look at it, I will then recall the \nworld and its allurements.” Thus, he swayed his heart away from this \nworld and destroyed its remembrance from his mind. He loved that its \nallurements should remain hidden from his eyes so that he would not \nsecure any good outfit from it, should not regard it as a place of stay and \nnot hope to linger in it. Consequently, he removed it from his mind, let it \ngo away from his heart and kept it hidden from his eyes. In the same way, \nhe who hates a thing should hate to look at it or to hear about it. \n \nCertainly there was in the Prophet of Allah (k) all that would \nwarn you of the evils of this world and its defects: He remained hungry \nalong with his main companions. Despite his great nearness, the \nallurements of the world remained remote from him. Now, one should see \nwith one’s intelligence whether Allah honored Muhammad (h) as a \nresult of this or disgraced him. If he says that Allah disgraced him, he \ncertainly lies and perpetrates a great falsehood. If he says, “Allah honored \nhim,” he should know that Allah dishonored the others when He extended \nthe (benefits of the ) world for them. Allah holds the same away from \nanyone who is the nearest to Him from among all men. \n \nTherefore, one should follow His Prophet (h), tread in his \nfootsteps and do as he did; otherwise, he will not be safe from ruin. \nCertainly Allah made Muhammad (h) a sign for the Day of Judgement, a \nconveyor of tidings for Paradise and a warner of retribution. The Prophet \n(k) left this world hungry but entered upon the next world safely. He did \nnot lay one stone upon another (to make a house) till he departed and \nresponded to the call of Allah. How great is Allah’s blessing in that He \nblessed us with the Prophet (h) as a predecessor whom we should \nfollow, a leader behind whom we should all march! \nHis Own Example \nBy Allah! I have been putting patches in my shirts, so much so \nthat now I feel shy of the patches themselves. Someone asked me whether \nI should put them [such patched garments] away, but I said, “Get away \nfrom me! Only in the morning do people (realize the advantage of and) \nspeak highly of the night journey [which they had undertaken].”"

    "text": "Deputation of the Holy Prophet (h)\nAllah deputed the Prophet (h) with a glittering light, a clear \nargument, an open path and a guiding Book. His tribe is the best tribe, and \nhis lineal tree is the best, one the branches of which are in good \nproportion and fruits hanging (abundantly). His birthplace was Mecca and \nthe place of his migration Taybah (Medna), from where his name rose \nhigh and his voice spread far and wide. \n \nAllah sent him with a sufficing plea, a convincing argument and a \nrectifying announcement. Through him did Allah disclose the ways that \nhad been forsaken and destroy the innovations that had been introduced. \nThrough Him he explained the detailed Commandments. Now, whoever \nadopts a religion other than Islam, his misery is definite, his pillar (of \nsupport) will be cracked, his fate will be in peril, his end will be a long \ngrief and a distressing punishment. \nDrawing Lessons from this World:\nI trust in Allah, the trust of bending towards Him, and I seek His \nguidance for the way that leads to His Paradise and takes to the place of \nHis pleasure. I admonish you, O servants of Allah, to fear Allah and to \nobey Him because doing so is salvation tomorrow and deliverance \nforever. He warned (you of chastisement) and did so thoroughly. He \npersuaded (you towards virtues) and did so fully. He described this world, \nits cutting away from you, its decay and shifting. Therefore, keep aloof \nfrom its attractions because very little of it will accompany you [on your \njourney back to Allah]. This abode is the closest to the displeasure of \nAllah and the remotest from the pleasure of Allah. \n \nSo close your eyes, O servants of Allah, from its worries and \nentanglements because you are sure about its separation and its changing \nconditions. Fear it like one who sincerely fears and one who struggles \nhard. Takes a lesson from what you have seen about the falling places of \nthose before you, namely those whose their joints vanished, their eyes and \nears destroyed, their honor and prestige disappeared and their pleasure \nand wealth came to an end. The nearness of their children changed into \nremoteness. The company of their spouses changed into separation from \nthem. They do not boast over each other, nor do they beget children, nor \ndo they meet each other nor live as neighbors. Therefore, have fear, O \nservants of Allah, like the fear of one who has control over himself, who \ncan check his passions and perceive with his wisdom. Surely, the matter is \nquite clear, the banner is standing, the course is level and the way is \nstraight."

    "text": "One of the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) (from \nBanu Asad) asked him: “How was it that your tribe (Quraish) \ndeprived you of this status (Caliphate) although you deserved it \nmost?” In his reply, the Imam said the following :\nO brother of Banu Asad! Your girth is loose and you have put it \non the wrong way. Nevertheless, you enjoy in-law kinship and also the \nright to ask. Since you have asked, listen. As regarding the oppression \nagainst us in this matter, although we were the highest in descent and the \nstrongest in kinship to the Messenger of Allah, it was a selfish act over \nwhich the hearts of people became greedy, although some people did not \ncare for it. The Arbiter is Allah and to Him is the return on the Day of \nJudgement.\n \nNow1 leave alone this story of devastation about which there is \nhue and cry all around. \n \nCome and look at the son of Abu Sufyan (Mu`awiyah). Time has \nmade me laugh after weeping. No wonder, by Allah; what is this affair \nwhich surpasses all wonder and which has increased wrongfulness? These \npeople have tried to put out the flame of Allah’s light from His lamp and \nclose His fountain from its source. They mixed epidemic-producing water \nbetween them and myself. If the trying hardships were removed from us, I \nwill take them on the course of truthfulness otherwise: \nSo let not thy self go (in vain) in grief for them; verily \nAllah knows all that they do. (Holy Quran, 35: 8) \nHere is an excerpt from a couplet by the famous Arab poet \nImri’ul-Qays al-Kindi: \n... And let me know the story of \nWhat happened to the riding camels! \n \nThe incident behind this couplet is that when the father of \nImri’ul-Qays, namely Hijr ibn al-Harith, was killed, the poet roamed \nabout the various Arab tribes to solicit their help to avenge his father’s \nmurder. During this endeavor, he stayed with a man of Jadilah tribe, but \nfinding himself unsafe, he left that place and stayed with Khalid ibn \nSadus an-Nabhani. In the meantime, a man of Jadilah named Ba’ith ibn \nHuways took away with some of the poet’s camels. Imri’ul-Qays \ncomplained of this matter to his host, asking him to send with him his \nshe-camels, then he would get back his own. Consequently, Khalid went \nto those people and asked them to return the camels of his guest which \nthey had stolen. They said that the poet was neither a guest [of theirs] nor \nunder his [host’s] protection. Thereupon, Khalid swore that the poet was \nreally his guest, showing them his she-camels that he had with him. They \nthen agreed to return the camels. But actually instead of returning the \ncamels, they drove away the she-camels as well173.\n \nAnother version of this incident is that they did return the camels \nto Khalid, but instead of handing them over to Imri’ul-Qays, the host kept \nthem for himself. When Imri’ul-Qays came to know this, he composed a \nfew couplets out of which this is one. It means “Now you leave the story \nof these camels which were stolen but just let me know about the she-\ncamels snatched from my own hands!” \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s intention in quoting this poetry verse, \nas an illustration, is that “Now that Mu`awiyah is at war, we should talk \nabout it and leave the discussion about the devastation generated by those \nwho had usurped my rights. That time [of the first calamity] has gone \naway. Now is the time for grappling with the mischief of the hour. So \ndiscuss the event of the moment and do not start an untimely strain.” \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said this because the man had put the \nquestion to him at the time of the Battle of Siffin, when the battle was \nraging and bloodshed was in full swing."

His primality \nhas no beginning, nor has His eternity any end. He is the First and \nforever. He is the everlasting without limit. Foreheads bow before Him \nand lips declare His Oneness. He determined the limits of things at the \ntime when He created them, keeping Himself away from any likeness. \n \n173As an editor, I apologize for admitting that I really do not know for \nsure what the details of the incident are. In the absence of the original text, I could \nnot make much sense of this paragraph, and I do not expect the reader to do any \nbetter! \nImagination cannot conceive Him as having any limits of \nmovements, or having any limbs or faculties [such as those of His \ncreatures]. It cannot be asked about Him: “Whence?” and no time limit \ncan be attributed to Him by saying, “till then.” He is apparent, but it \ncannot be asked, “from what?” He is hidden, but it cannot be asked, “in \nwhat?” He is not a body which can die, nor is He veiled so as to be \nenclosed. He is not near to things by way of touch, nor is He remote from \nthem by way of separation. \n \nThe gazes of people’s eyes are not hidden from Him, nor the \nrepetition of words, nor the glimpse of hillocks, nor the tread of a footstep \nin the dark night or in the deep gloom, where the shining moon casts its \nlight and the effulgent sun comes in its wake, through its setting and \nappearing again and again with the rotation of time and periods, by the \napproach of the advancing night or the passing away of the fleeting day. \n \nHe precedes every extremity and limit, every counting and \nnumbering. He is far above what those who attribute any limited attribute \nto Him, such as the qualities of measure, having extremities, living in \nhouses and dwelling in abodes because limits are meant for creation and \nare attributable only to those other than Allah. \nAllah: Originates from Nothing\n \nHe did not create things from eternal matter nor after existing \nexamples. Rather, He created whatever He created then He fixed limits \nthereto. He shaped whatever He shaped, ging the best shape thereto. \nNothing can disobey Him, but anyone’s obedience is of no benefit to \nHim. His knowledge about those who died in the past is the same as His \nknowledge about the survivors. His knowledge about whatever there is in \nthe high skies is like His knowledge of whatever there is in the low earth. \nPart of the Same Sermon: Creation of Mankind, the \nrequirements of life\nO creature who has been equitably created and who has been \nnurtured and looked after in the darkness of wombs with multiple \ncurtains! You were originated from the essence of clay (Holy Quran, 23: \n12), placed in a still place for a known length (Holy Quran, 77: 21-22) \nand an ordained time. You used to move in the womb of your mother as \nan embryo, neither responding to a call nor hearing any voice. \nThen you were taken out of your place of stay to a place you had \nnot seen before and you were not acquainted with the means of awaiting \nits benefits, or with who guided you to eke out your sustenance from the \nudder of your mother. And when you were in need, He appraised you of \nthe location of what you required or aimed at. Alas! Certainly he who is \nunable to understand the qualities of a being with shape and limbs is more \nunable to understand the qualities of the Creator and the more remote \nfrom appreciating Him through the limitations."

    "text": "When people went to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in a \ndeputation and complained to him about Othman, requesting him to \nspeak to him on their behalf and to admonish him for their sake, he \nwent to see Othman to whom he said the following : 1\n \nThe people are behind me and they have made me an ambassador \nbetween you and themselves; but by Allah, I do not know what to say to \nyou. I know nothing (in this matter) which you do not know, nor can I \nlead you to any matter of which you are not aware. You certainly know \nwhat we know. We have not come to know anything before you which we \ncould tell you, nor did we learn any secret which we should reveal to you. \nYou have seen as we have seen and you have heard as we have heard. \nYou sat in the company of the Prophet of Allah (h) as we did. (Abu \nBakr) the son of AbiQuhafah as well as (Umar) ibn al-Khattab were no \nmore responsible for acting righteously than you, since you are nearer \nthan both of them to the Prophet of Allah (k) through kinship and you \nalso hold relationship to him by marriage which they do not have. \n \nThen (fear) Allah, with regard to your own self for, by Allah, you \nare not being shown anything as if you are blind or being apprised of \nanything as if you are ignorant. Everything is clear while the banners of \nfaith are fixed. You should know that among the servants of Allah, the \nmost distinguished person before Allah is the just imam who has been \nguided (by Allah) and who guides others. So, he stands by the recognized \nways of the Prophet’s behavior and destroys unrecognized innovations. \nThe (Prophet’s) ways are clear and they have signs, while innovations are \nalso clear and they, too, have signs. Certainly, the worst man before Allah \nis the oppressive imam who has gone astray and through whom others go \nastray. He destroys the accepted Sunnah and revives abandoned \ninnovations. I heard the Messenger of Allah saying: “On the Day of \nJudgement, the oppressive imam will be brought with none to support him \nor to advance excuses on his behalf. Then he will be thrown into Hell \nwhere he will rotate as the hand-mill rotates, then (eventually) he will be \nconfined to its hollow. \n \nI swear to you by Allah that you should not be such an imam of \nthe people who will be killed because it has been said that an imam of this \npeople will be killed after which killing and fighting will be made open \nfor them till the Day of Judgement and he will confuse their matters and \nspread troubles over them. As a result, they will not distinguish right from \nwrong. They will oscillate like waves and will be utterly misled. You \nshould not behave as the beast of burden for Marwan [ibn al-Hakam, your \ncousin] so that he may drag you wherever he likes, despite (your) \nseniority of age and length of life. \n \nIt was then that Othman said the following to Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x): “Ask the people to give me time till I redress their grievances.” \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “As far as Medina is concerned, time is \nout of the question. As for more remote areas, you can have the time \nneeded for your order to reach your objectives.” \n \nDuring the Caliphate of Othman, the Muslims were weary of the \noppression of the Government. Its officials gathered in Medina to \ncomplain to the senior companions of the Prophet (h). They came to \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in a peaceful manner and requested him to \nsee Othman and advise him not to trample on the Muslims’ rights and to \nput an end to the troubles which were proving to be the cause of the \npeople’s ruin. It was then that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) went to him \nand spoke those words. \nIn order to make the bitterness of the admonition palatable, Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) adopted that way of speech in the beginning which \nwill create a sense of responsibility in the addressee and direct him \ntowards his obligations. Thus, by referring to his being a companion of \nthe Prophet (h), his personal status and kinship to the Prophet (h) as \ncompared with the two caliphs who preceded him, his intention was to \nmake him realize his duties. At any rate, this was obviously not an \noccasion for eulogizing him, so its latter portion can be disregarded and \nthe whole speech be regarded as a praise of his accomplishments because \nfrom its very beginning, it is evident that whatever Othman did, he did it \nwilfully, that nothing was done without his knowledge or his being \ninformed, and that he could not be held unaccountable for it because of \nhis being unaware of it. \n \nIf the adoption of a line of action which made the whole Islamic \nworld raise hue and cry in spite of his having being a companion of the \nProphet (h), having heard his instructions, having seen his behavior and \nhaving been acquainted with the commandments of Islam, can be \nregarded as a distinction, then this taunt may also be regarded as a praise. \nIf that is not a distinction, then this, too, cannot be called a praise. In fact, \nthe words about which it is argued, i.e. that they are complimentary, are \nenough to prove the seriousness of his crime because a crime in ignorance \nand unawareness is not so serious as the one carrying the weight given to \nthe seriousness of the commission of a crime despite one’s knowledge \nand awareness. Consequently, a person who is unaware of the rise and fall \nof a road and stumbles in the dark night is to be excused, but a person \nwho is aware of the rise and fall of the road, so he stumbled in broad day \nlight, is liable to be blamed. If, on this occasion, he is told that he has eyes \nand is also aware of the rise and fall of the way, it will not mean that his \nvastness of knowledge or the brightness of his eyesight is being praised, \nbut the intention will be that he did not notice the pitfalls despite his eyes \nand did not walk properly. For him, therefore, having or not having eyes \nis the same and knowing is equal to not knowing at all. \n \nIn this regard, a great emphasis is placed on his being a son-in-\nlaw of the Prophet (h), having married two of daughters, namely \nRuqayya and Umm Kulthum, one after the other174\nBefore taking this to be a distinction, the real nature of Othman as \nthe Prophet’s son-in-law should be scrutinized. History shows that in this \nmatter Othman did not enjoy the distinction of being the first [to marry \nthem]. Before him, Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum had been married to two \nsons of Abu Lahab, namely Utbah and Utaybah [who is condemned in the \nHoly Quran]. Yet despite their being sons-in-law, they were not been \nincluded among the people of prestige during the time preceding the dawn \nof Prophethood. How, then, can this be regarded as a source of distincion \nwithout any personal merit, when there is no authority about the \nimportance of this relationship, nor was any importance attached to this \nmatter in such a way that there might have been some competition \n \n174Many historians assert that both Ruqayya and Umm Kulthum were \ndaughters of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife, by her second husband, Ateeq ibn \n`Aaith of Banu Makhzum. Both ladies, therefore, were not daughters of the \nProphet (k) but his step-daughters. \nbetween Othman and some other important personality in this regard and \nthat his selection for it might have given him prominence, or that the two \nladies might have been shown to possess an important status in history, \ntradition or biography as a result of which this relationship could be given \na special importance and regarded as a cause of one’s distinction?! If the \nmarriage of these two daughters to Utbah and Utaybah during the period \nof jahiliyya is held as lawful on the ground that marriage with the \nunbelievers had not till then been made unlawful, then in Othman’s case, \nthe condition for lawfulness was his acceptance of Islam. There is no \ndoubt that he had pronounced the Kalima (ash-shahadatayn: “There is no \ngod but Allah and Muhammad (h) is His Messenger”) and had accepted \nIslam publicly. As such, this marriage can be held a proof of his \nacceptance of Islam. But no other honor can be proved through it. Again, \nit is also not agreed upon that these two ladies were the real daughters of \nthe Messenger of Allah because there is one group [of historians] which \ndisproves their being the Prophet’s real daughters, tracing their descent as \nthe daughters of Khadija’s sister, Halah, or her daughters by her own \nprevious [second] husband. Thus, Abul-Qasim al-Kufi (d. 352 A.H.) \nwrites the following:. \n \n“Some time prior to the Messenger of Allah (k) marrying \nKhadija, [Abu] Halah [second husband of Khadija] died, leaving two \ndaughters, one named Zainab and the other named Ruqayyah. Both of the \nlatter were [later] raised by the Prophet (h) and Khadija, looking after \nthem as it was the custom before Islam when a child was assigned to \nwhoever brought him up” (Al-Istighatha, p.69). \n \nIbn Hisham has written the following about the issues of Hadrat \nKhadija:.\n \n“Before her marriage to the Prophet (h), she was married to Abu \nHalah ibn Malik. She delivered for him Hind, son of Abu Halah, and \nZainab, daughter of Abu Halah. Before her marriage to Abu Halah, she \nhad been married to `Utayyiq [or `Ateeq according to other references] \nibn Abid ibn Abdillah ibn Amr ibn Makhzum and she delivered for him \nAbdullah and a daughter” (Al-Sira al-Nabawiyya, Vol. 4, p. 293). \n \nThis prove that Hadrat Khadija had two daughters before being \nmarried to the Prophet (h). According to all evidences, they will be \ncalled his “daughters” and those to whom they were married will be \ncalled his “sons-in-law,” but the status of this relationship will be the \nsame as if those girls were his daughters. Therefore, before putting it forth \nas a matter of pride, the real status of the daughters should be noted and a \nglance should be cast at Othman’s conduct. In this regard, al-Bukhari and \nother narrators (of traditions) as well as historians record this tradition as \nfollows:.\n \nAnas ibn Malik relates that: “We were present on the occasion of \nthe burial of the Prophet’s daughter Umm Kulthum. While the Prophet \n(h) was sitting beside her grave, I saw his eyes shedding tears. Then he \nsaid, ‘Is there anyone among you who has not committed a sin last night?’ \nAbu Talhah (Zayd ibn Sahl al-Ansari) said, ‘I’ The Prophet (h) said, \n‘Then you get into the grave.’ He got down into the grave.” \n \nThe commentators said that by “committed a sin”, the Holy \nProphet (h) meant to say “anyone who had not had sexual \nintercourse.”175\nOn this occasion, the Holy Prophet (h) unveiled the private life \nof Othman and prevented him from getting down into the grave, although \nit was a prominent merit of the Prophet’s character that he did not \ndisgrace or belittle anyone by publicly exposing his private life and \ndespite his knowledge of others’ shortcomings which he ignored. But in \nthis case, the filth was such that it was deemed necessary to disgrace him \nbefore the whole crowd. \n \nSince Othman did not show any regard for the demise of his wife \n(Umm Kulthum), nor was he moved or felt sorry (for this event), thus \npaying no heed to severing his relationship with the Holy Prophet (h)\n(for being his son-in-law), he (Othman) had a sexual intercourse on the \nsame night; therefore, the Holy Prophet (h) deprived him of this right \nand honor. For more details, refer to: al-Bukhari, Sahih, Vol. 2, pp. 100-\n101, 114; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al-Musnad, Vol. 3, pp. 126, 228, 229, 270; \nal-Hakim, Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 4, p. 47; al-Bayhaqi, Al-Sunan al-Kubra, \nVol. 4, p. 53; Ibn Sa`d, Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Vol. 8, p. 26; as-Suhayli, \nAl-Rawd al-Anif, Vol. 2, p. 107; Ibn Hajar, Al-Isaba, Vol. 4, p. 489; Fath \nal-Bari, Vol. 3, p. 122; al-Ayni, `Umdat al-Qari, Vol. 4, p. 85; Ibn al-\nAthir, Al-Nihaya, Vol. 3, p. 276; Ibn Manzur, Lisan al-`Arab, Vol. 9, pp. \n280-281; az-Zabidi, Taj al-Arus, Vol. 6, p. 220. \n \n175Is committing any sexual intercourse a sin?! Not at all if it is with \none’s own wife; it will be regarded as a good deed as we are told in hadith. But \nsuch is the text we have to work with. As an editor, I had to work with this text \nwithout the good fortune of comparing it with the original Arabic text."

    "text": "Describing the Wonderful Creation of the Peacock, the \nWonderful Creation of Birds\nAllah has provided wonderful creations including the living, the \nlifeless, the stationary and the moving. He has established such clear \nproofs for His delicate creative power and great might that minds bend \ndown to Him in acknowledgment thereof and in submission to Him and \narguments about His oneness strike our ears. He has created birds of \nvarious shapes which live in the burrows of the earth, in the openings of \nhigh passes and on mountain peaks. \n \nThey have different kinds of wings and various characteristics. \nThey are controlled by the rein of (Allah’s) authority. They flutter with \ntheir wings in the expanse of the vast firmament and the open atmosphere. \nHe brought them into existence from non-existence in strange external \nshapes and composed them with joints and bones covered with flesh. He \nprevented some of them from flying easily in the sky because of their \nheavy bodies and allowed them to use their wings only close to the \nground. He has set them in different colors by His delicate might and \nexquisite creative power. \n \nAmong them are those which are tinted with one hue and there is \nno other hue except the one in which they have been dyed. There are \nothers which are tinted with one color and they have a neck ring of a \ndifferent color than that with which they are tinted. \nAbout the Peacock \nThe most amazing among them in its creation is the peacock \nwhich Allah has created in the most symmetrical dimensions and arranged \nits hues in the best arrangement with wings the ends of which are inter-\nweaved together and with a long tail. When it approaches its female, it \nspreads out its folded tail and raises it up so as to cast a shade over its \nhead, as if it were the sail of a boat being pulled by the sailor. It feels \nproud of its colors and sways with its movements. It copulates like the \ncocks. It leaps (on the female) for cohabitation like lustful energetic men \nat the time of fighting. \n \nI am telling you all this from observation, unlike he who narrates \non the basis of a weak authority. For example, it is the belief of some \npeople that it cohabits with the female by a tear which flows from its \neyes. When it stops on the edges of the eyelids, the female swallows it \nand lays its eggs thereby, not through cohabitation by a male other than \nby means of this flowing tear. Even if they say this, it will be no more \namazing than (what they say about) the mutual feeding of the crows (prior \nto cohabitation). You will imagine its feathers to be like sticks made of \nsilver and the wonderful circles and sun-shaped feathers growing there to \nbe of pure gold and pieces of green emerald. If you likened them to \nanything growing on land, you will say that it is a bouquet of flowers \ncollected during every spring. If you likened them to clothes, they will be \nlike printed apparels or amazing variegated clothes of Yemen. If you \nlikened them to ornaments, then they will be like gems of different color \nwith studded silver. \n \nThe peacock walks with vanity and pride, throwing open its tail \nand wings, laughing, admiring the handsomeness of its outfit and the hues \nof its necklace of gems. But when it casts its glance at its legs, it cries \nloudly with a voice which indicates its call for help, displaying its true \ngrief because its legs are thin like the legs of Indo-Persian cross-bred \ncocks. At the end of its shin, there is a thin thorn, and on the crown of its \nhead, there is a bunch of green variegated feathers. Its neck begins in the \nshape of a goblet and it stretches up to its belly like the hair-dye of \nYemen in color or like silk cloth put on a polished mirror which looks as \nif it has been covered with a black veil. Other than that, on account of its \nexcessive luster and extreme brightness, it appears that a lush green color \nhas been mixed with it. Along the openings of its ears there is a line of \nshining bright daisy color like the thin end of a pen. Whiteness shines on \nthe black background. There is hardly a hue from which it has not taken a \nbit and improved it further by regular polish, luster, silken brightness and \nbrilliance. It is, therefore, like scattered blossoms which have not been \nseasoned by the rains of spring or the summer sun. \n \nIt also sheds its plumage and puts off its outfit. They all fall away \nand grow again. They fall away from the feather stems like the falling of \nleaves from twigs, then they begin to join together and grow till they \nreturn to the state that existed before their falling away. The new hues do \nnot change from the previous ones, nor does any color occur anywhere \nother than in its own place. If you carefully look at one hair from the hairs \nof its feather stems, it will look like a red rose, then like emerald green, \nthen like golden yellow. \n \nHow can sharpness of intellect describe such a creation, or faculty \nof mind, or the utterances of describers manage to tell of it? Even its \nsmallest parts have made it impossible for the imagination to pick them \nout or for tongues to describe them. Glorified is Allah Who has disabled \nintellects from describing the creation which He placed openly before the \neyes and which they see bounded, shaped, arranged and colored. He also \ndisabled tongues from briefly describing its qualities and also from \nexpanding in its praise. \nThe magnificence of the Creator in Great and Small \nCreations\nGlorified is Allah Who has assigned feet to small ants and gnats \nand also to those above them, the serpents and the elephants. He has made \nit obligatory upon Himself that no skeleton in which He infuses a spirit \nwill move, but that death is its promised place and destruction its final \nend.\nPart of the Same Sermon: Describing Paradise\nIf you cast your mind’s eye at what is described to you about \nParadise, your heart will begin to hate the delicacies of this world that \nhave been displayed here, namely its desires and its pleasures and the \nbeauties of its scenes. And you will be lost in the rustling of the trees \nwhose roots lie hidden in the mounds of musk on the banks of the rivers \nin Paradise and in the attraction of the bunches of fresh pearls on the \ntwigs and branches of those trees and in the appearance of different fruits \nfrom under the cover of their leaves. These fruits can be picked without \ndifficulty as they come down at the desire of their pickers. Pure honey and \nfermented wine will be handed round to those who settle down in the \ncourtyards of its palaces. \n \nThey are a people whom honor has always followed till they were \nmade to settle in the house of eternal abode, and they obtained rest from \nthe movement of journeying. O listener! If you busy yourself in \nadvancing towards these wonderful scenes which will rush towards you, \nthen your heart will certainly die due to eagerness for them, and you will \nbe prepared to seek the company of those in the graves, straight away \nfrom my audience here, and hasten towards them. May Allah, through His \nmercy, include us and yourselves, too, among those who strive with their \nhearts for the abodes of the virtuous. \nNote explaining some of the wonderful and obscure portions \nof this sermon:.\n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “In the words of Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x): ‘Aya’urru bimalaqihihi, ‘al-arr’ implies copulation, e.g. \nWhen it is said, ‘arra’r-rajulu al-mar’ata ya’urruha,’ it means ‘He \ncopulated with the woman.’” \n \nIn his words “Aka’annahu qal’u dariyyin anajahu nutiyyuhu, al-\nqal,” he means the sail of a boat. “Dari” means belonging to Darin, a \nsmall town on the coast from where scents are bought. And “anajahu” \nmeans Aturned it. It is said, “anajtun’n-naqata” like “nasartu - a’najuha \nanjan” when you turn the she-camel. And “an-nuti” means “sailor”. His \nwords “daffatay jufunihi” mean: edges of the eyelids, since “ad-daffatan” \nmeans: The two edges. As for his words “wa filadhu’z-zabarjadi,” “al-\nfiladh” is the plural of “al-fildhah”; it means “piece”. His words “ka \nba’isi’l-lulu’i’r-ratibi”: “al-kibasah” means “bunch of dates”. “Al-`asalij” \nmeans twigs. Its singular is “`Usluj”."

You covet the \ncaliphate.” I said to him, “Rather, you are, by Allah, more greedy, \nalthough more remote from it, while I am more suited as well as nearer. I \nhave demanded it as my right, while you are intervening between me and \nit and you are turning my face from it.” When I knocked at his ears with \narguments among the crowd of those present he was startled as if he was \nstunned not knowing what reply to give me about it. \n \nO Lord! I seek Your succor against the tribesmen of Quraish and \nthose who are assisting them because they are denying me (the rights of) \nkinship, have lowered my high status and are united in opposing me in the \nmatter (of the caliphate) which is my right then they said, “Be informed \nthat the rightful thing is that you have it and also that you may leave it.”177\n \n“They (the tribesmen of Quraish and those who are assisting \nthem) were not only content to keep me away from my right over the \n \n176During the incident of the Consultative Committee, Sa`d ibn Abu \nWaqqas repeated to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) what `Umar had said in his last \nhours, that is, that “O Ali! You are very greedy for the status of Caliphate.” Ali \n(x) replied: “He who demands his own right cannot be called greedy; rather, \ngreedy is he who prevents the securing of ones right and tries to grab it despite \nbeing unfit for it.” \n \nThere is no doubt that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) considered the \nCaliphate to be his right and demanded it. The demand for one’s right does not \ndispel a right so that it may be put forth as an excuse for not assigning him the \ncaliphate, and the demand may be held as a sign of greed. Even if it was greed, \nwho was not involved in this greed? Was not the pull between the Muhajirun \nand the Ansar, the mutual struggle between the members of the “Consultative \nCommittee” and the mischief mongering of Talhah and az-Zubayr the product of \nthis very greed? If Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had been greedy for this status, \nhe would have stood for it regardless of tis consequences and outcomes. When \nAbbas (uncle of the Prophet [h]) and Abu Sufyan pressed him to (accept to \nswear the oath of) allegiance, and when, after the third Caliph, people thronged \nto him for (swearing) allegiance, he had to accept their offer regardless of the \ndeteriorated conditions. But at no time did Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) take any \nstep which indicated that he wanted the Caliphate for the sake of caliphate. \nRather, his demand for the caliphate was only with the objective that its aspects \nshould not be altered, and the religion should not become the victim of others’ \ndesires, not that he should enjoy the pleasures of life which could be attributed \nto greed. \n177Explaining the meaning, Ibn Abul-Hadid writes that Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib’s intention was to say: \ncaliphate which they have usurped (from me), but rather claimed that it \nwas their right whether to give it to me or prevent me from the same, and \nthat I have no right to argue with them.”Furthermore, the intention (of \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)) was as follows: “Had they not said that it \nwas right to keep away from the caliphate, it would have been easy to \nendure it. This is so because this will have, at least, showed their \nadmitting my right although they were not prepared to concede it” (Sharh \nNahjul-Balagha, Vol. 9, p. 306). \nPart of the Same Sermon: Describing the People of Jamal \nThey (Talhah, az-Zubayr and their supporters) came out dragging \nthe wife of the Messenger of Allah (Aisha) just as a bondmaid is dragged \nfor sale. They took her to Basra where those two (Talhah and az-Zubayr) \nput their own women in their houses while exposing the wife of the \nMessenger of Allah to themselves and to others in the army in which \nthere was not a single individual who had not pledged his obedience and \nsworn to me allegiance quite willingly, without any compulsion. \n \nHere in Basra, they approached my Governor and coffers of the \npublic treasury, the funds of its other inhabitants. They killed some of \nthem in captivity as well as others in treachery. By Allah, even if they had \nwillfully killed only one individual from among the Muslims without any \nfault, it will have been lawful for me to kill all of this army because they \nwere present in it but did not disagree with it nor prevented it by tongue \nor hand, not to say that they killed from among the Muslims a number \nequal to that with which they had marched on them."

By my life, if the question of Imamate was not \nto be decided unless all the people were present, then there would be no \nsuch case. But those who agreed about it imposed the decision on those \nwho were absent, so much so that he who was present could not dissent, \nand the one who was absent could not choose (any one else). Be informed \nthat I shall fight two persons: one who claims what is not his, and the \nother who ignores what is obligatory upon him. \nThe Need for Wisdom in Fighting Against Muslims\nO servants of Allah!

Be informed that it will not last for you, nor \nwill you live along with it. If anything out of this world deceives you (i.e. \nattracts you), its own evils warn you, too. You should give up (the objects \nof) its deceit in favor of (the objects of) its warning and (the objects of) its \nattraction in favor of (the objects of) its horrors. And while being in it, \nadvance towards that house to which you have been called and turn your \nhearts away from the world. None of you should cry like a bondmaid over \nanything which she has been deprived of. Seek the perfection of Allah’s \nbounty over you through endurance in obeying Allah and in safeguarding \nwhat He has asked you to safeguard, namely His Book. \n \nBe informed that the loss of anything of this world will not harm \nyou so long as you have guarded the principles of your religion. Know \nalso that after the loss of your religion, nothing of this world, for which \nyou have cared, will ever benefit you.

And the principle was adopted \nthat those present at the election had no right to reconsider the matter or to \nbreak the allegiance and those not present could do nothing but acquiesce \nin the agreed decision. But when the people of Medna swore allegiance at \nthe hands of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), the Governor of Syria \n(Mu`awiyah) refused to follow suit on the ground that since he was not \npresent on the occasion he was not bound to abide by it, whereupon Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) replied in this sermon on the basis of these accepted \nand agreed principles and conditions which had been established among \nthese people and had become unable to convert. AWhen the people of \nMedna and the Ansar and the Muhajirun have sworn allegiance on my \nhand, Mu`awiyah had no right to keep aloof from it on the ground that he \nwas not present on the occasion, nor were Talhah and az-Zubayr entitled \nto break the pledge after swearing allegiance. \n \nOn this occasion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) did not argue on \nthe strength of any saying of the Prophet (h) which will serve as his final \nsay about the caliphate because the grounds for refusal in his case was \nwith regard to the modus operandi of the principle of election. Therefore, \nin keeping with the requirements of the situation a reply based on the \nagreed principles of the adversary could alone quiet him. Even if he had \nargued on the strength of the Prophet’s command it will have been \nsubjected to various interpretations and the matter will have been \nprolonged instead of being settled. Again Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had \nseen that soon after the death of the Prophet (h) all his sayings and \ncommands had been set aside.

He (the Prophet (h)) informed me of all this and also of the death \nof everyone who dies, the salvation of everyone who is granted salvation \nand the consequences of this matter (the caliphate). He left nothing (that \ncould) pass into my head without putting it in my ear and telling me about \nit.\n \nO people! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I \npractice it before you, nor do I restrain you from any disobedience unless \nI desist from it before you. \n \nThose who drink from the springs of revelation and the Divine \ninspiration are able to see things that are hidden behind the curtains, \nthings of the unknown, and the events which will occur in the future. \nThey do so in the same way as objects are seen with the eyes. This does \nnot contradict with the following statement of Allah: “Say: ‘None (either) \nin the heavens or in the earth knows the unseen save Allah’” (Holy Quran, \n27: 65) because this verse contains the negation of personal knowledge of \nthe unknown, but not the negation of knowledge which is required by the \nprophets and holy persons through the Divine inspiration by virtue of \nwhich they make prophecies about the future and unveil many events and \nhappenings. Several verses of the Holy Quran support this view such as:. \n \n“When the Prophet (h) confided a matter to one of his wives, she \ndivulged it (to others) and Allah informed him of it. He revealed a part of \nit and avoided a part. So, when he informed her of it, said she: ‘Who \ninformed you of this?’ He said, “The All-knowing, the All-aware \ninformed me’” (Holy Quran, 66: 3). \n \n“These are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal to you \n(O Our Prophet Muhammad)...”(Holy Quran, 11: 49). \n \nIt is, therefore, wrong to argue in support for the view that if it is \nsaid that the prophets and holy persons possess knowledge of the \nunknown, this will imply duality with regard to the Divine attributes. It \nwill have implied duality if it were said that someone other than Allah has \npersonal knowledge of the unknown. When it is not so, and the \nknowledge of the Prophets and Imams is given by Allah, it has no \nconnection with duality. If duality should mean what is alleged, what will \nbe the status of Isa’s (Jesus’s) assertion related thus in the Holy Qurany: \n“... .Out of clay will I make for you like the figure of a bird, and I \nwill breathe into it and it shall become a flying bird by Allah’s \npermission, and I shall heal the blind and the leper and will cause the dead \nto rise to life by Allah’s permission, and I will declare to you what you eat \nand what you store in you houses” (Holy Quran, 3: 49). \nIf it is believed that Aisha (Jesus) could create and bestow life \nwith Allah’s permission, does this mean that he was Allah’s partner in the \nattributes of creation and revival? If this is not so, then how can it be said \nthat if Allah gives someone the knowledge of the unknown, it implies that \nhe has been taken him to be His partner in His attributes? And how can \nanyone extol one’s belief in the Oneness of Allah by holding that the \nknowledge of the unknown implies duality? \n \nNo one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams \ncertain things which have yet to occur in the future, or that things can be \nread through interpretation of the dream, while during a dream neither do \nthe senses function nor do the powers of understanding and \ncomprehension operate. Therefore, if some events become known to some \npeople while being awake, why should there be amazement over it, and \nwhat are the grounds for rejecting it when it stands to reason that things \npossible in dreams are also possible in wakefulness? Thus, Ibn Maytham \nal-Bahrani has written that it is possible to achieve all this because in a \ndream the spirit becomes free from looking after the body and is removed \nfrom bodily connections. As a result of this, it perceives such hidden \nrealities which could not be seen because of the obstruction of the body. \nIn the same way, those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily matters \nand turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the center of \nknowledge can see those realities and secrets which the ordinary eyes are \nunable to discern. Therefore, keeping in view the spiritual greatness of \nAhl al-Bayt (x), it should not appear strange that they were aware of \nevents which were going to occur in the future. Ibn Khaldun has written \nthe following:. \n \n“When thaumaturgic feats are performed by others, what do you \nthink about those who were distinguished for their knowledge and \nhonesty and were a mirror of the Prophet’s traits, confiding what Allah \nhad for them on account of their noble lineage, is a proof of the high \nperformances of his chaste offspring (Ahl al-Bayt [x]). Consequently, \nmany events about knowledge of the unknown are related about Ahl al-\nBayt (x), events which are not related about others” (Al-Muqaddima, p. \n23).\nThus, there is no cause for wonder over Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib’s claim since he was brought up by the Prophet (h) and was a \nstudent in Allah’s school. Of course, those whose knowledge does not \nextend beyond the limits of physical goals and whose means of learning \nare confined to the bodily senses refuse to believe in the knowledge about \nthe paths of the Divine cognizance and reality. If this kind of claim was \nunique and was heard only from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), then minds \ncould have wavered and temperaments could have hesitated to accept it. \nBut if the Holy Quran records even such a claim of Aisha (Jesus) that “... \nI can tell you what you eat or drink or store in your houses...” then why \nshould there be any hesitation about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim \nwhen it is agreed upon that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had succeeded in \nattaining distinctions of the Prophet (h), and it cannot be disputed that \nthe Prophet (h) did not know what Aisha (Jesus) knew. Thus, if the \nsuccessor of the Prophet (h) advances such a claim, why should it be \nrejected, particularly since this vastness of knowledge of Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) is the best testimony and proof of the Prophet’s knowledge \nand perfection, a living miracle testifying to his truthfulness. \n \nIn this regard, it is amazing that even having knowledge of events \nwhich Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) did not, through any of his words or \ndeeds, indicate that he knew them. Thus, commenting about the \nextraordinary importance of this claim, Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes the \nfollowing:.\n \n“An amazing aspect of this claim is that despite the fact that \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was aware of conditions and events, he \nobserved such conduct by way of his words and deeds that one who saw \nhim could not believe that he knew the secrets and unknown acts of others \nbecause the wise agree that if a person knows what event is likely to take \nplace or what step his comrade is going to take, or if the hidden secrets of \npeople are known to him, then the effects of such knowledge will appear \nthrough his movements and the expressions of his face. But the man who, \nin spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way as though he is unaware \nand knows nothing, personality is a miracle and a combination of \ncontradictions. \n \nAt this stage, the question arises as to why Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) did not act upon the dictates of his secret knowledge. The reply \nto this is that the commands of the Shar`a are based on apparent \nconditions; otherwise, secret knowledge is a kind of miracle and power \nwhich Allah grants to His prophets and Imams. Although the prophets and \nImams possess this power always, they cannot make use of it at any time \nunless and until there is permission of Allah and on the proper occasion. \nFor example, the verse quoted above about Aisha (Jesus) which tells that \nhe had the power to give life, to heal the blind and declare what one ate \nand stored in his house, etc. he (Jesus) was not used to practice this power \non everything or every corpse or everyone who met him. He used to \npractice this power only by the permission of Allah and on the proper \noccasion.\n \nIf prophets and other holy men acted on the basis of their secret \nknowledge, it would have meant serious dislocation and disturbance in \nthe affairs of the people. For example, if a prophet, or the Almighty, on \nthe basis of his secret knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by killing \nhim, there will be a great commotion and agitation among those who see \nit on the ground that he killed an “innocent” man. This is why Allah has \nnot permitted the basing of conclusions on secret knowledge except in a \nfew special cases, enjoining the following of observable factors. Thus, \ndespite his being aware of the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the \nProphet (h) extended to them the amicable treatment that be extended to \nother Muslims. \n \nNow, there can be no room for the objection that if Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) knew secret matters, then why did he not act accordingly? \nThe answer is: It has been demonstrated that he was not obliged to act \naccording to the requirements of his secret knowledge. Of course, where \nconditions so required, he did, indeed, disclose some matters for the \npurposes of preaching, admonishing, giving good tidings (of rewards) or \nwarning (against punishments), so that future events could be avoided. \nFor example, Imam Ja`far as-Sadiq (x) informed Yahya ibn Zayd that if \nhe marched out [against the Umayyads], he would be killed. Ibn Khaldun \nwrites the following in this regard:. \n \n“It has been authentically related from Imam Ja`far as-Sadiq that \nhe used to forewarn some of his close relatives of the fateful events to fall \nupon them. For example, he forewarned his cousin Yahya ibn Zayd of \nbeing killed, but the latter disobeyed him; he marched out and was \nmartyred in Juzjan” (Al-Muqaddama, p. 233). \nNevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would \nworry, such was not disclosed at all. That is why in this sermon Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) avoided more details in view of his apprehension that \npeople would begin to regard him as being higher than the Prophet (h).\nDespite all of this, people did, in fact, go astray about Isa (Jesus). \nLikewise with regard to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), some people also \nstarted saying all sorts of things and were thus misled into resorting to \nexaggeration."

    "text": "Admonishing \n(O creatures!) Seek benefit from the sayings of Allah, be \nadmonished of Allah and accept the advice of Allah because Allah has \nleft no excuse for you when He has provided clear guidance for you, has \nput before you the plea and clarified for you what deeds He likes and \nwhat deeds He hates, so that you may ac upon one and avoid the other. \nThe Prophet of Allah (k) used to say, “Paradise is surrounded by \nunpleasant things, while Hell is surrounded by desires.” \n \nYou should know that every act of obedience to Allah is \nunpleasant in appearance while every disobedience to Allah has the \nappearance of enjoyment. May Allah have mercy on the person who \nkeeps aloof from his desire and uproot the appetite of his heart because \nthis heart has far-reaching aims, yet it goes on pursuing disobedience \nthrough desires. \n \nYou should know, O servants of Allah, that a believer should be \ndistrustful of his heart every morning and evening. He should always \nblame it (for shortcomings) and ask it to add to (its good deeds). You \nshould behave like those who have gone before you and those ahead. \nThey left this world like a traveler and covered it as distance is covered. \nThe Greatness of the Holy Quran\nAnd be aware that this Holy Quran is an adviser that never \ndeceives, a leader who never misleads, and a narrator who never speaks a \nlie. No one will sit in the company of this Holy Quran except that when \nhe rises, he will achieve one addition or one diminution: addition in his \nguidance or elimination in his (spiritual) blindness. You should also know \nthat no one will need any thing beyond (guidance from) the Holy Quran \nand no one will be free from want beyond (guidance from) the Holy \nQuran. Therefore, seek cure from it for your ailments and seek its \nassistance in your distresses. It contains a cure for the most serious \ndiseases, \nnamely \nunbelief, \nhypocrisy, \nrebellion \n(against \nGod’s \ncommandments) and misguidance. Pray to Allah through it and turn to \nAllah through loving it. Do not ask the people through it. There is nothing \nlike it through which the people should turn to Allah, the Sublime. \n \nBe informed that it intercedes. Its intercession will be accepted. It \nis a speaker that testifies. For whoever the Holy Quran intercedes on the \nDay of Judgement, its intercession for him will be accepted. He about \nwhom the Holy Quran speaks ill on the Day of Judgement shall testify to \nit. On the Day of Judgement, an announcer will announce: ‘Beware! \nEveryone who sow a crop is in distress except those who sow (the seeds) \nof the Holy Quran.” Therefore, you should be among the sowers of the \nHoly Quran and of its followers. Make it your guide towards Allah. Seek \nits advice for yourselves. Ddo not trust your views against it and regard \nyour desires in the matter of the Holy Quran as deceitful. \nAbout the believers and their good deeds, and the hypocrites \nand their bad deeds \nAction! Action! Then (look at) the end results (of your actions \nand remain) steadfast. Steadfast! Thereafter, (exercise) endurance. \nEndurance and piety, piety! You have an objective. Proceed towards your \nobjective. You have a sign. Take guidance from your sign. Islam has an \nobjective. Proceed towards its objective. Proceed towards Allah by \nfulfilling His rights which He has enjoined upon you. He has clearly \nstated His demands. I am a witness for you and shall plead for excuses on \nyour behalf on the Day of Judgement. \n \nBeware! What had been ordained has occurred, and that which \nhad been destined has come to pass. I am speaking to you with the \npromise and pleas of Allah. \n \nAllah the Sublime has said the following: “Verily, those who say: \n‘Our Master is Allah! and who persevere rightly, the angels descend upon \nthem (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve and receive the glad tidings of the \nGarden which you were promised’” (Holy Quran, 41: 30). \n \nYou have said, “Our Master is Allah;” so, remain steadfast to His \nBook, to the way of His command, and to the virtuous course of \nworshiping Him. Thereafter, do not go out of it, do not introduce \ninnovation in it, and do not turn away from it because those who shrink \nfrom this course will be cut off from (the mercy of) Allah on the Day of \nJudgement.\n \nBeware of corrupting your manners and altering them. Maintain \none stand. A man should control his tongue because the tongue is \nobstinate with its master. By Allah, I do not find fear of Allah benefitting \na man who practices such fear unless he controls his tongue. Certainly the \ntongue of a believer is at the back of his heart, while the heart of a \nhypocrite is at the back of his tongue. When a believer intends to say \nanything, he thinks it over in his mind. If it is good, he discloses it, but if \nit is bad, he keeps it concealed. A hypocrite articulates whatever comes to \nhis tongue, without knowing what is in his favor and what goes against \nhim. \n \nThe Prophet of Allah (h) said the following: “The belief of a \nperson cannot be firm unless his heart is firm, and his heart cannot be firm \nunless his tongue is firm.” So, anyone of you can manage to meet Allah, \nthe Sublime, in such a status that his hands are not smeared with the blood \nof Muslims and their property and his tongue are safe from exposition, he \nwill do so. \nFollowing the Sunnah and Refraining from Innovation\nBe informed, O servants of Allah, that a believer should regard \nlawful this year what he regarded lawful the past year and should consider \nunlawful this year what he considered unlawful in the past year. Certainly \npeople’s innovation cannot make lawful for you what has been declared \nas unlawful. Rather, lawful is that which Allah has made lawful, and \nunlawful is that which Allah has made unlawful. You have already tested \nthe matters and tried them; you have been admonished by those before \nyou. Illustrations have been drawn for you, and you have been called to \nclear facts. Only a deaf man can remain deaf to all this, and only a blind \nman can remain blind to all this. \n \nHe whom Allah does not allow to benefit from trials and \nexperiences cannot benefit from preaching. He will be confronted by \nlosses as he witnesses them, so much so that he will approve what is bad \nand disapprove what is good. People are of two categories; followers of \nthe Shar`a (religious laws) and followers of innovations to which Allah \nhas not given any testimony by way of Sunnah or the light of any plea. \nGuidance from the Holy Quran\nThe Holy Quran is the strong rope of Allah and the trustworthy \nmeans to reach out to Him. It contains the blossoming of the heart and the \nsprings of knowledge. For the heart, there is no other gloss than the Holy \nQuran, although those who remembered it have passed away while those \nwho forgot or pretended to have forgotten it have remained. If you see \nanything good, give your support to it, but if you see evil, avoid it because \nthe Messenger of Allah (k) used to say: “O son of Adam! Do good and \nshun evil; by doing so, you will be treading the Path correctly.” \nCategories of Oppression\nBe informed that injustice is of three kinds: 1) the injustice that \nwill not be forgiven; 2)one, that will not be left unquestioned and 3) the \none that will be forgiven without being questioned. The injustice that will \nnot be forgiven is duality of Allah. Allah has said the following: “Verily, \nAllah does not forgive that (anything) be associated with Him” (Holy \nQuran, 4: 48, 116). The injustice that will be forgiven is the injustice one \ndoes to his own self by committing minor sins. The injustice that will not \nbe left unquestioned is the injustice of men against other men. The \nretribution in such a case is severe. It is not wounding with knives, nor \nstriking with whips, but it is so severe that all these things are \ninsignificant compared to it. You should, therefore, avoid alteration with \nregard to Allah’s religion, for your unity with regard to something right \nwhich you dislike is better than your disunity with regard to something \nwrong that you like. Certainly, Allah, the Glorified One, has not given \nany person, whether among the dead or among the living, anything good \nfrom disunity. \n \nO people! Blessed is the man whose own shortcomings keep him \naway from (looking into) the shortcomings of others. Also blessed is the \nman who is confined to his house, who eats his meal, buries himself in \nobedience to his Lord and weeps over his sins, so he keeps himself thus \nbusy while people are safe from his harm."

Nor has He begotten anyone so as to be \ninherited. Time has not preceded Him. Increase and decrease do not apply \nto Him. But He has manifested Himself to our understanding when we \nobserve His strong control and firm decree. Among the proofs of His \ncreation is the creation of the skies which are fastened without pillars, \nstanding without support. He called them and they responded obediently \nand humbly without being reluctant or loathsome. If they had not \nacknowledged His being the Lord and not obeyed Him, He would not \nhave made them the place for His throne, the abode of His angels and the \ndestination of the pure utterances and righteous deeds of the creatures. \n \nHe has made the stars in the skies by way of signs for the \nguidance of travelers who traverse the various routes of the earth. The \ngloom of the dark curtains of the night does not prevent the flame of their \nlight, nor do the veils of blackish nights have the power to turn back the \nlight of the moon when it spreads in the skies. Glory to Allah from Whom \nneither the blackness of dark dusk nor of gloomy nights in the low parts \nof the earth or on high dim mountains is hidden, nor the thundering of \nclouds on the horizons of the skies, nor the sparking of lightning in the \nclouds, nor the falling of leaves blown away from their falling places by \nthe winds of hurricanes or by downpour from the sky.

He cannot be perceived \nby imagination nor measured by comprehension. He who pleads to Him \ndoes not divert Him (from others), nor does giving away cause Him \ndiminution. He does not see by means of an eye, nor can He be confined \nto a place. He cannot be said to have companions. He does not create with \n(the help of) limbs. He cannot be perceived by senses.

But when he exhausted \nappointed ration (of this world) and his (fixed) time expired, the bow of \ndestruction shot him with an arrow of death. His mansions became vacant \nand his habitations became empty. Another group of people inherited \nthem. Certainly, the by-gone centuries have a lesson for you. \n \nWhere are the Amalekites181 and the sons of the Amalekites? \nWhere are the Pharaohs?182 \nBut when his empire in the end was \n \n181History shows that very often the ruin and destruction of peoples has \nbeen due to their oppression and open wickedness and profligacy. Consequently, \ncommunities which had extended their sway over all the corners of the \npopulated world and had flown their flags in the East and West of the globe \ndisappeared from the surface of the earth like a wrong word, on disclosure of \ntheir vicious actions and evil doings. The Amalekites were ancient nomadic \ndestroyed in a few moments. Neither his status nor his servants could \ncome in the way of its destruction, nor could the vastness of his realm \n \ntribesmen, or a group of tribes, described in the Old Testament as relentless \nenemies of Israel, even though they were closely related to Ephraim, one of the \ntwelve tribes of Israel. Their name is derived from Amalek, who is celebrated in \nArabian tradition but cannot be identified. The region over which they ruled \nextended from southern Judea and probably extended into northern Arabia. The \nAmalekites harassed the Hebrews during the latter’s exodus from Egypt, \nattacking them at Rephidim (near Mt. Sinai), where they were defeated by \nJoshua. They also filled out the ranks of the nomadic raiders defeated by Gideon \nand were condemned to annihilation by Samuel. The Amelekites, whose final \ndefeat occurred in the time of Hezekiah, were the object of a perpetual curse. \n(See The New Encyclopedia Britannica [Micropedia], Vol. 1, p. 288, ed. 1973 - \n1974]; also see [for further reference] the Encyclopedia Americana\n[International Edition] Vol. 1, p. 651, ed. 1975). \n182“Pharaoh” is a Hebrew word form of the Egyptian “per-Ao”, the \ngreat house, signifying the royal palace, an epithet applied in the new Kingdom \nand after, as a title of respect, to the Egyptian king himself. In the 22nd dynasty, \nthis title was added to the king’s personal name. In official documents, the full \ntitulary of the Egyptian king contained five names. The first and the oldest \nidentified him as the incarnation of the falcon god Horus. It was often written \ninside a square called ‘serekh”, depicting the facade of the archaic palace. The \nsecond name, “two ladies”, placed him under the protection of Nekh-bet and \nButo, the vulture and Uraeus (snake) goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt. The \nthird, “golden Horus”, originally signified perhaps Horus victorious over his \nenemies. The last two names, written within a ring or cartouche, are generally \nreferred to as the praenomen and nomen and were the ones most commonly \nused. The praenomen, preceded by the hieroglyph meaning “King of Upper and \nLower Egypt”, usually contained a reference to the king’s Unique relationship \nwith the sun god, Re, while the fifth, or nomen, was preceded by the hieroglyph \nfor “son of Re”, or by that for Master of the Two Lands. The last name was \ngiven him at birth, the rest at his coronation. (The New Encyclopedia Britannica\n[Micropodia], Vol. VII, p. 927, ed. 1973-1974; also see [for further reference] \nthe Encyclopedia Americana, [International Edition], Vol. 21, p. 707, ed. 1975). \nAmong the Pharaohs was Pharaoh who was contemporary to Prophet \nMusa (x). His pride, egotism, insolence and haughtiness were such that by \nmaking the claim “I am your supreme god,” he deemed himself to be holding \nsway over all other powers of the world. He was confused into \nmisunderstanding that no power could wrest the realm and government from his \nhands. The Holy Quran has narrated his claim of “I and no one else” in the \nfollowing verse: And Pharaoh proclaimed to his people: “O my people! Is not \nthe kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flow below me; What! behold you \nnot? (Holy Quran 43: 51) \nprevent it. Rather, the waves of the very streams of which he was \nextremely proud, wrapped him in and dispatched his soul to Hell, \nthrowing the body on the bank to serve as a lesson for the whole of \ncreation. Where are the people of the cities of ar-Rass183 who killed the \nprophets, destroyed the traditions of the holy messengers and revived the \ntraditions of the despots? Where are those who advanced with armies, \ndefeated thousands, mobilized forces and populated cities? \nPart of the same sermon about Imam al-Mahdi (x)\nHe will be wearing the amour of wisdom, which he will have \nsecured with all its conditions, such as full attention towards it, \n(complete) knowledge of and exclusive devotion to it. For him, it is like a \nthing which he had lost and which he was then seeking, or a need which \nhe was trying to fulfil. If Islam is in trouble, he will feel forlorn like a \ntraveler and like a (tired) camel beating the end of its tail, with its neck \nflattened on the ground. He is the last of Allah’s proofs and one of the \nvicegerents of His prophets. \nOn the Method of His Ruling and Grief over the Martyrdom \nof His Companions \nO people! I have divulged to you advice which the prophets used \nto preach to their peoples, and I have conveyed to you what the \nvicegerents (of the prophets) conveyed for the benefit of those coming \nafter them. I tried to train you with my whip but you could not be \nstraightened. I drove you with admonition but you did not acquire proper \nbehavior. May Allah deal with you! Do you want an Imam other than me \nto take you on the (right) path and show you the correct way? \n \nBeware, the things in this world which were forward have \nbecome things of the past, and those which were behind are going ahead. \n \n183Who were the people of the cities of ar-Rass? In the same way as \nabove, the people of ar-Rass were killed and destroyed for disregarding the \npreaching and the call of their prophet and for their rebellion and disobedience. \nAbout them the Holy Qur’an says the following: And the (tribes of) }d and \nThamud, and the inhabitants of ar-Rass, and generations between them, in great \nnumber. And unto each of them We did give examples and everyone (of them) \nWe did destroy with utter destruction (Holy Quran 25: 38,39); Belied (also) \nbefore them were the people of Noah and the dwellers of ar-Rass and Thamud, \nand }d and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot, and the dwellers of the Wood and \nthe people of Tubba’; all belied the Messengers, so My promise (of the \ndoom)was proved true (Holy Quran 50: 12-14).\nThe virtuous people of Allah have made up their minds to leave and they \nhave traded, with a little perishable (pleasure) of this world, a lot of such \n(reward) in the next world that will remain forever. What loss did our \nbrothers, whose blood was shed in Siffin, suffer by not being alive today? \nOnly that they are not suffering from choking upon swallowing and not \ndrinking turbid water. By Allah, surely they have met Allah and He has \nbestowed upon them their rewards; He has lodged them in safe houses \nafter their (having suffered) fear. \n \nWhere are my brethren who took the (right) path and trod in \nrighteousness/ Where is Ammar? Where is ibn at-Tayyihan? Where is \nDhul-Shahadatayn? And where are others like them7 from among their \ncomrades who had pledged themselves to remain steadfast till death and \nwhose (severed) heads were taken to the wicked enemy? \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) wiped his hand over his auspicious, \nhonored beard and wept for a long time, then he went on to say: \n \nO brothers who recited the Holy Quran and strengthened it, \nthought over their obligation and fulfilled it, revived the Sunnah and \ndestroyed innovation! When they were called to jihad, they responded and \ntrusted in their leader then followed him. \nImam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Shouted the Following at the Top \nof His Voice: \nAl-Jihad, al-Jihad! O servants of Allah! By Allah, I am \nmobilizing the army today. He who desires to proceed towards Allah \nshould come forward. \nNawf says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) put \nHussain (x) in charge of (a force of) ten thousand, Qays ibn Sa`d (mercy \nof Allah be upon him) over ten thousand, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari over ten \nthousand and others over different numbers, intending to return to Siffin. \nBut on Friday, the Imam (x) did not appear in public again; the damned \nIbn Muljim (may Allah curse him) killed him. Consequently, the armies \ncame back and were left like sheep who had lost their shepherd while \nwolves were snatching them away from all sides. \n \nAmmar ibn Yasir ibn Amir al-Madhhaji al-Makhzumi (Madhhaj \nbeing an ally of Banu Makhzum) was one of the earliest converts to Islam \nand the first Muslim to build a mosque in his own house in which he used \nto worship Allah (Al-Tabaqat, Vol. 3, Part 1, p. 178; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. \n4, p. 46; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol. 7, p.311). \n \nAmmar accepted Islam along with his father Yasir and his mother \nSumayya. They suffered great atrocities at the hands of the tribesmen of \nQuraish due to their conversion to Islam to such an extent that Ammar \nlost his parents, and they were the first martyrs in Islam. \n \nAmmar was among those who immigrated to Abyssinia and the \nearliest immigrants (Muhajirun) to Medina. He was present in the battle \nof Badr and all other battles as well as places of assembly by the Muslims \nduring the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (h). He demonstrated his mighty \nsupport in all Islamic struggles in the best way. \n \nMany traditions are narrated from the Holy Prophet (h) about \nAmmar regarding his virtues, outstanding traits and glorious deeds such \nas the tradition which Aisha and others have narrated that the Holy \nProphet (h) himself had said that Ammar was filled with faith from the \ncrown of his head to the soles of his feet. (Ibn Majah, Sunan, Vol. 1, p. \n65; Abu Nu’aym, Hilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 1, p. 139; al-Haytami, Majma’ \naz-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, p.295; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1137; Al-Isaba, Vol. 2, p. \n512).\n \nIn another tradition, the Holy Prophet (h) said the following \nabout Ammar:. \n \n“Ammar is with the truth and the truth is with Ammar. He turns \nwherever the truth turns. Ammar is as close to me as an eye is close to the \nnose. Alas! A rebellious group will kill him” (Al-Tabaqat, Vol. 3, part 1, \np. 187; Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 392; Ibn Hisham, Sira, Vol. 2, p. 143; \nIbn Kathir, Tarikh, Vol. 7, pp. 268-270). \n \nAlso in the decisive and widely known tradition which al-Bukhari \n(in his Sahih, Vol. 8, pp. 185-186), at-Tirmithi (in Al-Jami’ Sahih, Vol. 5, \np. 669); Ahmed ibn Hanbal (in Al-Musnad, Vol. 2, pp. 161, 164, 206; \nVol. 3, pp. 5, 22, 28, 91; Vol. 4, pp. 197, 199; Vol. 5, pp. 215, 306, 307; \nVol. 6, pp. 289, 300, 311, 315) and all the narrators of Islamic traditions \nand historians transmitted through twenty-five Companions that the Holy \nProphet (h) said the following about Ammar:. \n \n“Alas! A rebellious group which swerves from the truth will \nmurder Ammar. Ammar will be calling them towards Paradise and they \nwill be calling him towards Hell. His killer and those who strip him of \narms and clothing will all be in Hell.” \n \nIbn Hajar al-Asqalani (in Tahthib al-Tahthib, Vol. 7, p. 409; Al-\nIsaba, Vol. 2, p.512) and al-Sayyuti (in Al-Khasa’is al-Kubra, Vol. 2, p. \n140) say: “The narration of this (above mentioned) tradition is mutawatir \n(i.e. narrated successively by so many people that no doubt can be \nentertained about its authenticity). \n \nIbn Abdul-Barr (in Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1140) says the \nfollowing:.\n \n“The narration followed uninterrupted succession from the Holy \nProphet (h) saiying the following: “A rebellious group will murder \nAmmar,” and this is a prediction of the Prophet’s secret knowledge and \nthe sign of his Prophethood. This tradition is among the most authentic \nand the most rightly ascribed traditions. \n \nAfter the death of the Holy Prophet (h), Ammar was one of the \nclosest adherents and best supporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nduring the reign of the first three Caliphs. During the caliphate of Othman \nwhen the Muslim population protested against Othman’s policy regarding \na number of issues including the distribution of the Public Treasury \n(baytul-mal) Othman said at a public assembly that, “The money which \nwas in the treasury was sacred and belonged to Allah and that he (as being \nthe successor of the Prophet [h)) had the right to dispose of them as he \nthought fit. He (Othman) threatened and cursed all those who presumed to \ncensure or murmur at what he said. Upon this, Ammar ibn Yasir boldly \ndeclared his disapprobation and began to charge him with his inveterate \npropensity to ignore the interests of the general public; accused him with \nreviving the heathenish customs abolished by the Prophet (h),\nwhereupon Othman ordereded him to be beaten. Imediately some \nUmayyads, the relatives of the Caliph fell upon the venerable Ammar and \nthe Caliph himself, kicking the lattedr with his shoes (on his feet) on \nAmmar’s testicles and afflicted him with a hernia. Amma became \nunconscious for three days and was taken care of by Umm al-Mu’minin \n[mother of the Faithful] Umm Salamah in her own house ( al-Baladhiri, \nAnsab al-Ashraf, Vol. 5, pp. 48, 54, 88; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 3, pp. 47-\n52; Al-Imamah wal-Siyasa, Vol. 1, pp. 35-36; Al-`Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, p. \n307; Al-Tabaqat, Vol. 3, Part 1, p. 185; Tarikh al-Khamis, Vol. 2, p. 271). \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) became Caliph, Ammar was \none of his most sincere supporters. Ammar participated fully in all social, \npolitical and military activities during this period, especially in the first \nbattle (the Battle of Jamal) and in the second (the battle of Siffin). \n \nHowever, Ammar was martyred on the 9th of Safar, 37 A.H., in \nthe battle of Siffin when he was over ninety years old. On the day Ammar \nibn Yasir achieved martyrdom, he turned his face to the sky and said the \nfollowing:.\n \n“O Lord! Surely You are aware that if I know that You wish that I \nshould plunge myself into this River (the Euphrates) and be drowned, I \nwill do it. O Lord! Surely You know that if I knew that You would be \npleased if I put my scimitar on my chest (to hit my heart) and press it so \nhard that it comes out of my back, I would do it. O Lord! I do not think \nthere is anything more pleasant to You than fighting this sinful group. If I \nknew that any action at all is more pleasing to You, I would do it.” \n \nAbu Abd ar-Rahman al-Salami narrates the following:. \n \n“We were present with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) at Siffin \nwhen I saw Ammar ibn Yasir not turning his face in any direction, or \ntowards any valley of Siffin, but the companions of the Holy Prophet (h)\nwere following him as if he was a sign for them. Then I heard Ammar say \nthe following to Hashim ibn Utbah (al-Mirqal): ‘O Hashim! Rush into the \nenemy’s ranks, for Paradise is under the shade of the sword! Today, I \nshall meet the beloved one, Muhammad (h) and his party.’ \n \n“Then he said the following: ‘By Allah! If they put us to fight \n(and pursue us) to the date-palms of Hajar (a town in Bahrain [i.e. if they \npursue us along all the Arabian desert] nevertheless) we know surely that \nwe are right and they are wrong.’ \n \n“Then he (Ammar) continued (addressing the enemies) thus: \n \n‘We struck you so that you may (believe in) its (Holy Quran\\s) \nrevelation; And today we strike you to (believe in) its interpretation; Such \nstrike as to remove heads from their resting places; And to make the \nfriend forget his sincere friend, until the truth returns to its (right) \ncourse.’” \n \nThe narrator says the following: “I did not see the Holy Prophet’s \ncompanions killed at any time as many as they were killed on that day.” \nThen Ammar spurred his horse, entered the battlefield and began \nfighting. He persistently chased the enemy, launching one attack after \nanother, raising challenging slogans till at last a group of mean-spirited \nSyrians surrounded him from all sides. A man named Abul-Ghadiyah al-\nJuhari (al-Fazari) inflicted such a wound upon him that Ammar could not \nwithstand it. Ammar returned to his camp and asked for water. A tumbler \nof milk was brought to him. When Ammar looked at the tumbler, he said \nthe following: “The Messenger of Allah had said the right thing.” People \nasked him what he meant by those words. He said, “The Messenger of \nAllah (k) informed me that my last sustenance in the life of this world \nwould be milk.” Then he took that tumbler of milk in his hands, drank the \nmilk and surrendered his life to Allah, the Almighty. When Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) came to know of his death, he came to Ammar’s side, put \nhis (Ammar’s) head on his own lap and recited the following elegy to \nmourn his death: \nSurely any Muslim who is not distressed at the killing of the son \nof Yasir and is not afflicted by this grievous misfortune does not have a \ntrue faith. \n \nMay Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he embraced \nIslam; may Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he was killed, and \nmay Allah shower His mercy on Ammar the day he is raised to life. \n \nCertainly, I found Ammar (on such level) that three companions \nof the Holy Prophet (h) could not be named unless he was the fourth, \nand four of them could not be mentioned unless he was the fifth... \n \nThere was none among the Holy Prophet’s companions who \ndoubted this: Not only was Paradise once or twice bestowed upon \nAmmar, but that he gained his claim to it (a number of times). May \nParadise give enjoyment to Ammar. \n \nCertainly, it was said (by the Holy Prophet [h]): “Surely, \nAmmar is with the truth, and the truth is with Ammar; he turns wherever \nthe truth turns; his killer will certainly be lodged in hell.” \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) stepped forward and offered the \nfuneral prayers for Ammar and with his own hands he buried him with his \nclothes still on. \nAmmar’s death caused a good deal of commotion in the ranks of \nMu`awiyah, too, because there a large number of prominent people \nfighting on the side of Mu`awiyah under the impression hat he was \nfighting Imam \n \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) for a just cause. These people were aware \nof the saying of the Holy Prophet (h) that Ammar would be killed by a \ngroup that would be on the wrong track. When they observed that Ammar \nhad been killed by Mu`awiyah’s army, they became convinced that they \nwere on the wrong side and that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was \ndefinitely on the track. This agitation thus caused among leaders as well \nas in the rank and file of Mu`awiyah’s army was quelled by the latter with \nthe argument that it was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) who brought Ammar \nto the battlefield and, therefore, it was he who was responsible for \nAmmar’s death. When Mu`awiyah’s argument was mentioned before \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), the Imam said that it was as if the Prophet \n(h) was responsible for killing [his brave uncle] Hamzah since he \nhimself had brought him to the battlefield of Uhud! (al-Tabari, Tarkh, \nVol. 1, pp. 3316-3322; Vol. 3, pp. 2314-2319; Ibn Sa`d, Al-Tabaqat, Vol. \n3, Part 1, pp. 176-189; Ibn al-Athir, Al-Kamil, Vol. 3, pp. 308-312; Ibn \nKathir, Tarikh, Vol. 7, pp. 267-272; al-Minqari, Siffin, pp. 320-345; Ibn \nAbdul-Barr, Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, pp. 1135-1140; Vol. 4, p. 1725; Ibn al-\nAthir, Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 4, pp. 43-47; Vol. 5, p. 267; Ibn Abul-Hadid, \nSharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 5, pp. 252-258; Vol. 8, pp. 10-28; Vol. 10, \npp. 102-107, al-Hakim, Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, pp. 384-394; Ibn Abd \nRabbih, Al-Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, pp. 340-343; al-Mas`udi, Muruj al-\nDhahab, Vol. 2, pp. 381-382, al-Haytami, Majama’ az-Zawa’id, Vol. 7, \npp. 238-244; Vol. 9, pp. 291-298; al-Baladhiri, Ansab al-Ashraf \n(Biography of Amir al-Mu’minin [x]), pp. 310-319. \n \nAbul-Haytham (Malik) ibn at-Tayyihan al-Ansari was one of the \ntwelve chiefs (naqibs [of the Ansar] who attended the fair and met at al-\nAqabah the first and the second times. It was there that he swore the \npledge of allegiance to the Holy Prophet of Islam (h). He was present \nalso during the battle of Badr and in all other battles in addition to all \nplaces of assembly by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Holy \nProphet (h). He was also among the sincere supporters of Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) on whose side he fought during the Battles of Jamal and of \nSiffin where he was martyred (Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, p. 1773; Siffin, p. 365; \nUsd al-Ghaba, Vol. 4, p. 274; Vol. 5, p. 318; Al-Isaba, Vol. 3, p. 341; \nVol. 4, pp. 312-313; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 10, pp. 107-108; Ansab al-\nAshraf, p. 319). \n \nKhuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari [who is referred to above] is \nknown as “Dhul-Shahadatayn” (the man with the two testimonials) \nbecause the Holy Prophet (h) considered his testimony equivalent to that \nof two witnesses. He was present in the battle of Badr and in other battles \nas well as in the places of assembly of the Muslims during the lifetime of \nthe Holy Prophet (h). He is counted among the earliest of those who \nshowed their adherence to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). He was also \npresent in the Battles of Jamal and Siffin. Abd ar-Rahman ibn Abu Layla \nnarrated that he saw a man in the battle of Siffin fighting the enemy \nvaliantly, and when he protested against his action, the man said the \nfollowing:.\n \n“I am Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari. I have heard the Holy \nProphet (h) saying, ‘Fight, fight, on the side of Ali’” ( orator al-\nBaghdadi, Muwaddih Awham al-Jam’ wal-Tafriq, Vol. 1, p. 277). \n \nKhuzaymah was martyred in the battle of Siffn soon after the \nmartyrdom of Ammar ibn Yasir. \n \nSayf ibn `Umar al-Usaydi (the well known liar) has fabricated \nanother Khuzaymah and claimed that the one who was martyred in the \nbattle of Siffin was this one and not the one titled “Dhul-Shahadatayn”. \nAl-Tabari has quoted this fabricated story from Sayf either intentionally \nor; otherwise, and through him this story has affected some other \nhistorians who quoted from or relied on al-Tabari. For further reference, \nsee al-‘Askari, Khamsun wa miah sahabi mukhtalaq [one hundred and \nfifty fabricated companions], Vol. 2, pp. 175-189. \n \nAfter having rejected this fabrication, Ibn Abul-Hadid adds (in \nSharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 10, pp. 109-110) that: “Furthermore, what is \nthe need for those who, in order to defend Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x),\nboast of an abundance of statements by Khuzaymah, Abul-Haytham, \nAmmar and others? If people treat this man (Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib [x]) \nwith justice and look at him with healthy eyes, they will certainly realize \nthat should he be alone (on one side) and all other people (on the other \nside) fighting him, he will still be on the side of the truth while all the rest \nwill be wrong” (Al-Tabaqat, Vol. 3, Part 1, pp. 185, 188; Al-Mustadrak, \nVol. 3, pp. 385, 397; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 2, p. 114; Vol. 4, p. 47; Al-\nIsti`ab, Vol. 2, p. 448; al-Tabari, Vol. 3, pp. 2316, 2319, 2401; Al-Kamil, \nVol. 3, p. 325; Siffin, pp. 363, 398; Ansab al-Ashraf, pp. 313-314). \n \n Among the people who were present during the Battle of Jamal \non the side of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) were one hundred and thirty \nBadris (those who participated in the battle of Badr with the Holy Prophet \n[h]) and seven hundred of those who were present in the Pledge of ar-\nRidwan (Bay’at al-Ridwan) which took place under a tree (al-Dhahbi, \nTarikh al-Islam, Vol. 2, p. 171; Khalifah ibn Khayyat, Tarikh, Vol. 1, p. \n164). Those who were killed in the Battle of Jamal from among the \nsupporters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) numbered about five hundred \n(some said that the number of martyrs were more than that). But on the \nside of the people of Jamal, twenty thousand were killed (Al-Iqd al-Farid, \nVol. 4, p. 326). \n \nAmong those who were present in the Battle of Siffin on the side \nof Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), there were eighty Badris and eight \nhundred of those who swore to the Holy Prophet (h) the Pledge of al-\nRidwan (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 104; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1138; Al-\nIsaba, Vol. 2, p. 389; Tarkh, al-Ya`qubi, Vol. 2, p. 188). \n \nOn the side of Mu`awiyah, forty-five thousand were killed, and \non the sides of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), twenty-five thousand. Among \nthese martyrs (from the camp of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib [x]), there were \ntwenty-five or twenty-six Badris and sixty-three or three hundred and \nthree of the people of the Pledge of ar-Ridwan (Siffin, p. 558; Al-Isti`ab, \nVol. 2, p. 389; Ansab al-Ashraf, p. 322; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 10, p. 104; \nAbul-Fida’, Vol. 1, p. 175; Ibn al-Wardi, Tarkh, Vol. 1, p. 240; Ibn \nKathr, Vol. 7, p. 275; Tarikh al-Khams, Vol. 2, p. 277). \n \nBesides the distinguished and eminent companions of Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x), such as Ammar, “Dhul-Shahadatayn” and Ibn al-\nTayyihan, those who were martyred in Siffin were: \n \n i. Hashim ibn `Utbah ibn Abu Waqqas al-Mirqal. He was killed \non the same day when Ammar was martyred. He was the bearer of the \nstandard of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army on that day. \n \n ii. Abdullah ibn Budayl ibn al-Warqa al-Khuza’i. Sometimes, he \nwas the right wing’s Commander of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s army and \nsometimes the infantry’s Commander."

He has fixed for everything a measure, for every measure a \ntime limit, and for every time limit a record. \nPart of the Same Sermon: the Greatness and Importance of \nthe Holy Quran\nThe Holy Quran bids and forbids, remains silent and speaks. It is \nthe Argument of Allah before His creation. He has taken from them a \npledge (to act) upon it. He has perfected its glory and completed through \nit His creed. He let the Prophet (h) leave this world once he had \nconveyed to the people all His commandments of guidance through the \nHoly Quran. You should, therefore, regard Allah as Great as He has held \nHimself Great because He has not concealed anything of His religion \nfrom you, nor has He left out anything which He likes or dislikes. He \nmade for everything a clear sign (of guidance) and a definite indication, \neither prohibiting (us) from doing it or calling upon us to uphold it. What \npleases Him is the same for now, in the past, and for all times to come. \n \nYou should know that He will not be pleased with you if you do \nanything with which He was displeased by those before you who \ncommitted it, and He will not be displeased with you for anything for \nwhich won His pleasure when acted upon by those before you. You are \ntreading on a clear path and are speaking the same as the people before \nyou had spoken. Allah suffices you for the achievement of your worldly \nneeds. He has persuaded you to remain thankful (with your hearts) and \nhas made it obligatory on you to mention Him with your tongues. \nWarning Against the Punishment on the Day of Judgement\nHe has advised you to be pious, making piety the highest point of \nearning His pleasure and all that He requires from His creatures. You \nshould, therefore, fear Allah in such a way as if you stand in front of Him. \nYour forelocks are in His grip and your change of condition is in His \ncontrol. If you conceal a matter from anyone, you cannot conceal it from \nHim. If you disclose a matter, He will record it. For this, He has appointed \nhonored guards (angels) who do not omit any rightful matter nor insert \nanything of their own. You should know that whoever fears Allah, He \nwill make for him a way to get out of troubles and (grant him) a light (to \nhelp him get) out of darkness. He will always keep him in whatever \n(condition) He wishes and will make him stay in a status of honor near \nHim, in the abode (of bliss)which He has made for Himself. The shade of \nthis abode is His throne; its light is His glory, its visitors are His angels, \nand its companions are His prophets. \n \nTherefore, hasten towards such a place of return and proceed to \n(your) ends (by collecting provision for the next world). Shortly, the \nexpectations of the people will be cut short and death will overtake them, \nwhile the door of repentance will be closed for them. You are still in a \nplace to which those who were before you have been wishing to return. In \nthis world, which is not your [eternal] abode, you are just like a traveler in \nmotion. You have been given the call to leave from here, and you have \nbeen ordered to collect provisions while you are still here. You should \nknow that this thin skin cannot tolerate the Fire (of Hell). So, have pity on \nyour own selves because you have already tried it in the tribulations of \nthis world. \n \nHave you ever seen how a person cries of the pain when he has \nbeen pricked with a thorn or who bleeds due to stumbling or whom hot \nsand has burnt? How will he feel when he is between two frying pans of \nHell with stones all around, with Satan as his companion? Do you know \nthat when Malik (the custodian of Hell) is angry with the fire, its parts \nbegin to clash with each other (in rage), and when he scolds it, it leaps \nbetween the doors of Hell crying on account of his scolding? \n \nO you old folks whom old age has made hoary, how will you feel \nwhen rings of fire touch the bones of your neck and when handcuffs hold \nyou so hard that they eat away the flesh of your forearms? (Fear) Allah! \n(Fear) Allah! O crowd of men, while you are in good health before \nsickness (grips you), when you are in ease before hardship (overtakes \nyou). You should aspire to release your necks before their mortgage is \nforeclosed, and your eyes; thin down your bellies, use your feet (to go \nwhere you earn the Pleasure of Allah); spend your wealth (rather than \nhoard it); take your bodies and wear them out for the goodness of your \nown souls, and do not be niggardly about them because Allah, the most \nGlorified One, has said the following: “If you help (yourselves and others \nin the way) of Allah, He will (also) help you and will set your feet firm \n(on His Straight Path) (Holy Quran, 47: 7). And He, the most Sublime \nOne, has said the following: “Who will loan unto Allah a goodly loan so \nthat He may double it for him and for him shall be a noble recompense?” \n(Holy Quran, 57: 11). \n \nHe does not seek your support because of being weak, nor does \nHe demand a loan from you because of being in need. He seeks your help, \nalthough He possesses all the armies of the skies and of the earth, and He \nis strong and wise. He seeks a loan from you, although He owns the \ntreasures of the skies and of the earth, and He is rich and praiseworthy. \n(Rather) He intends to try you as to which of you performs good deeds. \nYou should, therefore, be quick in performance of (good) deeds so that \nyour way may be with His neighbors in His abode. He made His \nProphet’s companions from among these neighbors and made the angels \nvisit them. He has honored their ears so that the sound of Hell-fire may \nnever reach them, and He has afforded protection to their bodies from \nweariness and fatigue. \n \n... That is the grace of Allah, He bestows it upon whomsoever He \npleases, and Allah is the master of Mighty Grace (Holy Quran, 57: 21). \n \nI say you hear me. I seek Allah’s help for myself and for you. He \nsuffices me, and He is the best dispenser (of bounties)."

    "text": "Praising Allah and His Wonderful Creatures\nPraise be to Allah! He is such that senses cannot perceive Him, \nplace cannot contain Him, eyes cannot see Him and veils cannot cover \nHim. He proves His eternity by the bringing His creation into existence \nand (also) by originating His creation. (He proves) His existence, and \nthrough their spirituality, He proves that there is nothing similar to Him. \nHe is true to His promise. He is too Sublime to be unjust to His creatures. \nHe stands by equity among His creation and implements justice over them \nin His commands. He provides testimony of His own being through the \ncreation of things from ever, through their marks of incapability of His \npower and through their powerlessness against death of His eternity. \n \nHe is One, but not by counting. He is everlasting without any \nlimit. He is existent without any support. Minds admit His existence \nwithout the need for the senses. Things which can be seen testify to Him \nwithout confronting Him. Imagination cannot encompass Him. He \nmanifests Himself to the imagination with his help for the imagination, \nrefusing to be conceived by the imagination. He has made imagination the \narbiter. He is not “big” in the sense that volume is vast, so His body is \nalso “big”. Nor is He great in the sense that His limits should extend to \nthe utmost, so His frame should be extensive. But He is ‘big” in status and \ngreat in authority. \nAbout the Holy Prophet (h)\nI testify that Muhammad (h) is His slave, His chosen Prophet \n(h) and His responsible trustee.May Allah bless him and his \ndescendants. Allah sent him with undeniable proofs, with a clear success \nand an open path. So he conveyed the message, declaring the truth with it. \nHe led the people on the (correct) path, established signs of guidance and \nminarets of light, making Islam’s ropes strong and knots firm. \nPart of the Same Sermon: About the Creation of Animal \nSpecies\nHad they pondered over the greatness of His power and the \nvastness of His bounty, they would have returned to the right path and \nfeared the punishment of the Fire. But hearts are sick and eyes are impure. \nDo they not see the small things which He has created, how He \nstrengthened their system and opened for them the hearing and the sight, \nmaking for them bones and skins? Look at the ant with its small body and \ndelicate form. It can hardly be seen in the corner of the eye, nor by the \nperception of the imagination. Look and see how it moves on the earth \nand leaps at its sustenance. It carries the grain to its hole and deposits it in \nits place of repose. It collects during the summer for its winter and during \nstrength for the period of its weakness. Its livelihood is guaranteed and it \nis fed to be fit. Allah, the Kind, does not forget it, and (Allah the Giver) \ndoes not deprive it, even though it may be in a dry stone or in fixed rocks. \n \nIf you have thought about its digestive tract, in its high and low \nparts, the carapace of its belly, its eyes and ears in its head..., you will be \namazed at its creation, and you will feel it difficult to describe it. Exalted \nis He Who made it stand on its legs and erected it on its pillars (limbs). \nNo other originator took part with Him in its origination, and no one else \nhas any power to assist Him in its creation. If you tread on the paths of \nyour imagination and let it reach its extremes, it will not lead you \nanywhere except to the fact that the Originator of the ant is the same as \nHe Who is the Originator of the date-palm because everything has (the \nsame) delicacy and detail, and every living being has little difference with \nanother.\nCreation of the Universe\nIn His creation, the big, the delicate, the heavy, the light, the \nstrong, the weak are all equal.184 So is the sky, the air, the winds and the \nwater. Therefore, look at the sun, moon, vegetation, plants, water, stone, \nthe difference of this night and day, the springing of the streams, the large \nnumber of the mountains, the height of their peaks, the diversity of \nlanguages and the variety of tongues. Then woe unto him who disbelieves \nin the One who ordains, who denies the Ruler! These believe that they are \nlike grass for which there is no cultivator nor any maker for their own \nsundry shapes. They have not relied on any argument for what they assert, \n \n184The meaning is: If the smaller thing in creation is examined, it will \nbe found to contain all that which is found in the biggest creatures. Each will \nexhibit the same reflection of nature, workmanship and performance and the \nratio of each to Allah’s might and power will be the same, whether it be as small \nas an ant or as big as a palm tree. Is it not that making a small thing is easy for \nHim while the making of a big thing is difficult because the diversity of color, \nvolume and quantity is just based on the dictates of His sagacity and \nexpediency? As regarding creation itself, there is no difference among them. \nTherefore, this uniformity of creation is a proof of the Oneness and Unity of the \nCreator.\nnor on any research for what they have heard. Can there be any \nconstruction without a constructor, or any offense without an offender? \nThe Wonderful Creation of the Locust\nIf you wish, you can tell about the locust (as well). Allah gave it \ntwo red eyes, lighted for them two moons like pupils, made for it small \nears, opened for it a suitable mouth and gave it a keen sense, gave it two \nteeth to cut with and two sickle-like feet to grip with. The farmers are \nafraid of it in the matter of crops. Farmers cannot drive the locust away \neven though they may join together in their effort. The locust attacks the \nfields and satisfies its hunger although its body is not equal to a thin \nfinger.\nThe Glory of Allah \nGlorified is Allah before Whom everyone in the skies or on earth \nbows down in prostration willingly or unwillingly, submits to Him by \nplacing his cheeks and face (on the dust), kneals before Him (in \nobedience) peacefully and humbly and hands over to Him full control in \nfear and apprehension. \n \nThe birds are bound by His commands. He knows the number of \ntheir feathers and their breaths. He has made their feet stand on water and \non dry land. He has ordained their livelihoods. He knows their species: \nThis is the crow, this is the eagle, this is the pigeon, and this is the ostrich. \nHe called out every bird by its name (while creating it) and provided it \nwith its livelihood. He created heavy clouds and produced from them \nheavy rain, spreading it on various lands. He drenched the earth after its \ndryness and grew vegetation from it after its barrenness."

    "text": "The Oneness of Allah. Principles of Knowledge \nHe who assigns to Him (different) conditions does not believe in \nHis Oneness, nor does he who likens Him in order to grasp His reality. He \nwho illustrates Him does not signify Him. He who points at Him and \nimagines Him does not mean Him. Everything that is known through \nitself has been created, and everything that exists by virtue of other things \nis the effect (of something else). He works but not with the help of \ninstruments. He fixes measures but not with the activity of thinking. He is \nrich but not by acquisition. \n \nTimes do not keep company with Him. His Being precedes times. \nHis Existence precedes non-existence, and His eternity precedes \nbeginning. By His creating the senses, it is known that He has no \n“senses”. By the contraries in various matters, it is known that He has no \ncontrary, and by the similarity between things, it is known that there is \nnothing similar to Him. He has made light the contrary of darkness, \nbrightness that of gloom, dryness that of moisture and heat that of cold. \nHe produces affection among opponents. \n \nHe fuses together diverse things, brings near remote things and \nseparates things which are joined together. He is not confined to limits, \nnor counted by numbers. Material parts can surround things of their own \nkind and organs can point out things similar to themselves. The word \nmundhu (i.e. since) disproves their eternity185, the word qad (that denotes \nnearness of time of occurrence), disproves their being from ever and the \nword lawla (if it were not) keep them remote from perfection. \n \nThrough them, the Creator manifests Himself to the intelligence, \nand through them He is guarded from the vision of the eyes. \n \nStillness and motion do not apply to Him. How can a thing occur \nin Him which He has Himself made to occur, and how can a thing revert \nto Him which He first created, and how can a thing appear in Him which \nHe first brought to appearance? If it had not been so, His Self will have \nbecome subject to diversity, His Being will have become divisible (into \nparts) and His reality will have been prevented from being deemed \n \n185The meaning here is: The words “mundhu, qad and lawla” have been \nmade to be the antitheses of the attributes of “ever, eternal and perfect”. \nTherefore, their application to anything will prove that they have come into \nexistence from non-existence and are imperfect. For example, “mundhu” is used \nto denote time as is “qad wujida mundhu kadha” (this thing is found since such-\nand-such time). Here, a time limit has been stated. Anything for which a limit of \ntime can be described cannot exist from ever or remain forever. The word “qad” \nshows (indicates the present perfect tense) the immediate past. This sense also \ncan apply to a thing which is limited in time. The word lawla is used to denote \nthe negation of something in another thing, such as “ma ahsanahu wa akmalahu \nlawla annahu kasha”; that is, “How beautiful and perfect it will be if it were \nsuch-and-such”. Therefore, the thing for which this word is used will be in need \nof others to compare how handsome and perfect what it describes is, and this \nword will remain deficient by itself. \nEternal. If there was a front to Him there will have been a rear also for \nHim. He will need completing only if shortage befell Him. In such case, \nsigns of the created will appear in Him and He will become a sign \n(leading to other objects) instead of signs leading to Him. Through the \nmight of His abstention (from affectedness) He is far above being affected \nby things which effect others. \n \nHe is that which does not change or vanish. The process of setting \ndoes not behoove Him. He has not begotten anyone lest He should be \nregarded as having been born. He has not been begotten; otherwise, He \nwill be contained within limits. He is too Sublime to have sons. He is too \npurified to contact women. Imagination cannot reach Him so as to assign \nHim quantity. Understanding cannot think of Him so as to give Him \nshape. Senses do not perceive Him so as to feel Him. Hands cannot touch \nHim so as to rub against Him. He does not change into any condition. He \ndoes not pass from one state to another. Nights and days do not turn Him \nold. Light and darkness do not alter Him. \n \nIt cannot be said that He has a limit or extremity, an end or \ntermination, nor do things control Him so as to raise or lower Him, nor \ndoes anything carry Him so as to bend Him or keep Him erect. He is not \ninside things nor outside them. He conveys news, but not with tongue or \nvoice. He listens, but not with the holes of the ears or the organs of \nhearing. He says but does not utter words. He remembers, but does not \nmemorize. He determines, but not by exercising His mind. He loves and \napproves without any sentimentality (of heart). He hates and feels angry \nwithout any painstaking. When He intends to create someone/something \nHe says, “Be!”, and there he/she/it is! But He does not do so through \nvoice that strikes (the ears). His speech is an indication of His creation. \nHis like never existed “before” nor “after”. \n \nIt cannot be said that He came into being after He had not been in \nexistence because, in that case, the attributes of the created things will be \nassigned to Him and there will remain no difference between them and \nHim, and He will have no distinction over them. Thus, the Creator and the \ncreated will become equal and the initiator and the initiated will be on the \nsame level. He created (the whole of) creation without any example made \nby someone else, and He did not secure the assistance of anyone out of \nHis creation for creating it. \n \nHe created the earth and suspended it without being ‘busy”, \nretained it without support, made it stand without legs, raised it without \npillars, protected it against bending and curving and defended it against \ncrumbling and splitting (into parts). He fixed mountains on it like stumps, \nsolidified its rocks, caused its streams to flow and opened its valleys wide. \nWhatever He made did not suffer from any flow, and whatever He \nstrengthened did not show any weakness. \n \nHe manifests Himself over the earth with His authority and \ngreatness. He is aware of its inside through His knowledge and \nunderstanding. He has power over everything on earth by virtue of His \nsublimity and dignity. Nothing from the earth that He may ask for defies \nHim, nor does it oppose Him so as to overpower Him. No swift-footed \ncreature can run away from Him so as to ahead of Him. He is not needy \ntowards any possessing person so that the latter should feed Him. All \nthings bow down to Him and are humble before His greatness. They \ncannot flee away from His authority to someone else in order to escape \nHis benefit or His harm. There is no parallel for Him that may match Him \nand no one like Him so as to equal Him. \n \nHe will destroy the earth after its existence, till all that exists on it \nwill become non-existent. But the extinction of the world after its creation \nis no more wonderous than its first formation and invention. How could it \nbe? Even if all the animals of the earth, whether birds or beasts, stabled \ncattle or pasturing ones, of different origins and species, dull people and \nsagacious men..., all jointly try to create (even) a mosquito, they are not \nable to bring it into being and do not understand what is the way to its \ncreation. Their wits are bewildered and wandering. Their powers fall \nshort, fail and return disappointed and tired, knowing that they are \ndefeated and admitting their inability to produce it, also realizing that they \nare too weak (even) to destroy it. \n \nSurely, after the extinction of the world, Allah, the most Glorified \nOne, will remain alone with nothing else besides Him. He will be, after its \nextinction, as He was before its production: without time or place or \nmoment or period. At this moment, period and time will not exist and \nyears and hours will disappear. There will be nothing except Allah, the \nOne, the Almighty. To Him is the return of all matters. Its initial creation \nwas not in its power, and the prevention of its extinction was (also) not in \nits power. Had it had the power to prevent it, it would have existed \nforever. When He made anything of the world, the making of it did not \ncause Him any difficulty and the creation of anything which He created \nand formed did not cause Him any fatigue. He did not create it to heighten \nHis authority nor for fear of loss or harm, nor to seek its help against an \noverwhelming foe, nor to guard against any avenging opponent with its \nhelp, nor for the extension of His domain by its help, nor for boasting \n(over the size of His possession) against a partner, nor because He felt \nlonely and desired to seek its company. \n \nAfter its creation, He will destroy it, but not because any worry \nhas overcome Him in its upkeep and administration, nor for any pleasure \nthat will accrue to Him, nor for the cumbrousness of anything over Him. \nThe length of its life does not weary Him so as to induce Him to its quick \ndestruction. Allah, the Glorified One, has maintained it with His kindness, \nkept it intact with His command and perfected it with His power. Then \nafter its destruction, He will resurrect it, but not for any need of His own \ntowards it, nor to seek the assistance of any of its things against it, nor to \nchange over from the condition of loneliness to that of company, nor from \nthe condition of ignorance and blindness to that of knowledge and search, \nnor from paucity and need towards needlessness and plenty, nor from \ndisgrace and lowliness towards honor and prestige."

    "text": "Steadfastness versus a Transient Belief \nOne belief is (conviction) which is firm and steadfast in the hearts. \nAnother remains temporarily in one’s heart up to a certain period of time. \nIf you were to acquit (yourselves) before anyone, you should wait till \ndeath approaches, for that is the time limit for being acquitted. \n \nMigration stands as its original status. Allah has no need for one \nwho secretly accepts belief or one who openly does so. Migration (to the \nother world) will not apply to any one unless he recognizes the proof (of \nAllah) on the earth. Whoever recognizes him and acknowledges him will \nbe a muhajir (immigrant). Istid’af (i.e. freedom from the obligation of \nmigration) does not apply to him whom the proof (of Allah) reaches and \nhe hears it and his heart preserves it.187\n \n187This is the interpretation of the words muhajir and mustad’af as \nmentioned in the Holy Quran: Verily those whom the angels take away (at the \ntime of death), being unjust to their (own) selves, they (the angels) shall ask (the \nsinning souls): “In what state were you? They shall reply: Weakened (mustad’af\n- oppressed) were we in the land; they (angels) will say: Was not the land of \nAllah vast (enough) for you to traverse therein?

Allah \nwill perhaps pardon them, and Allah is the Clement, the Oft-forgiving One (4: \n97-99). The meaning of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) here is that hijra\n(migration) was not only obligatory during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (h), \nThe challenge of “Ask me before you miss me” and a \nprediction about the Umayyads\nCertainly, our case is difficult and complicated. No one can bear it except \na believer whose heart Allah has tried with belief. Our traditions will not \nbe preserved except by trustworthy hearts and (men of) firm \nunderstanding. O people! Ask me before you miss me because certainly I \nam acquainted with the passages of the sky more than the passages of the \nearth, and before that mischief springs upon its feet which will trample \neven the nose string and destroy the wits of the people. \n \nSome people have explained this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) to mean that by the passages of the earth he means matters of \nthe world and by passages of the sky matters of religious law and that \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) intends to say that he knows the matters of \nreligious law and commandments more than the worldly matters. Thus, \nIbn Maytham al-Bahrani writes (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 4, pp. \n200-201):. \n \nAllama al-Wabari is quoted as having said that the gist of the \nintention of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) is this: The scope of his religious \nknowledge is greater than his knowledge about matters relevant to the \nworld.\n \nBut taking the context into account, this explanation cannot be \nheld as correct because this sentence (being explained) has been used as \nthe cause of the sentence “Ask me before you miss me” and after it is the \nprediction of a rebellion. In-between these two, the occurrence of the \nsentence “I know religious matters more than worldly matters” makes the \nwhole utterance quite disregarded because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s \nchallenge to ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of the \nreligious law only, so this sentence could be held as its cause. After that, \nthe prediction of the rebellion has nothing to do with matters of the \n \nbut it is a permanent obligation. This migration is nowadays obligatory for \nattaining the proof of Allah and the true religion. Therefore, if one has attained \nthe proof of Allah and believed in it, even if he is in midst of the unbelievers of \nhis locality, he is not duty-bound to migrate. \n \nThe mustad’af (weakened) is one who is living among the unbelievers \nand is far from being informed of the proofs of Allah and, at the same time, he is \nunable to migrate in order to attain knowledge of the Signs of Allah. \nreligious law so that it could be put forth as a proof of more knowledge of \nreligious matters. To ignore the clear import of the words and to interpret \nthem in a way which does not suit the occasion, does not exhibit a correct \nspirit when from the context also the same meaning accrues, one which \nthe words openly convey. Thus, it is to give a warning about the \nUmayyad’s mischief that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) uttered the \nstatement “Ask me whatever you like because I know the paths and \ncourses of the Divine destiny more than the passages of the earth. So, \neven if you ask me about matters which are recorded in the Preserved \nTablet and which concern the Divine destiny, I can tell you. A serious \nmischief is to rise against me in those matters in which you should have \ndoubt because my eyes are more acquainted with those ethereal lines \nwhich concern the occurrence of events and mischiefs than with what I \nknow about life as it appears on earth. The occurrence of this mischief is \nas certain as an object seen with the eyes. You should, therefore, ask me \nabout its details and about how to keep safe from it, so that you may be \nable to manage your defense when the time comes.” This meaning is \nsupported by the successive sayings of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) which \nhe uttered with regard to the unknown and to which future events did, \nindeed, testify. Thus, Ibn Abul Hadid comments on this claim of Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) as follows: \n \n“Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s claim is also supported by his \nstatements about future events which he uttered not once or a hundred \ntimes but continuously and successively. From them, there remains no \ndoubt that whatever he spoke was on the basis of knowledge and \ncertainty, not by chance” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 13, p. 106). \n \nWith regard to this saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), it has \nalready been demonstrated and explained (in"

    "text": "Importance of Fearing Allah, Desolateness of the Grave, \nDeath of Those Who Love Ahl Al-bayt (x) Similar to That of Martyrs \nI praise Him out of gratitude for His rewards and I seek His \nassistance in fulfilling my obligations to Him. He has a strong host. His \ndignity is grand. I testify that Muhammad (k) is His slave and Prophet. \nHe called (people) to His obedience and overpowered His enemies when \nfighting for His religion. People’s joining together to falsify Him and their \nattempt to extinguish His light were of no avail. \n \nYou should, therefore, be steadfast in your fear of Allah because \nit has a rope the knot of which is strong, its pinnacle is lofty and \ninvulnerable. Hasten towards death in its pangs (by doing good deeds) \nand be prepared for it before its approach because the ultimate end is the \nDay of Judgement. This is enough admonishment for one who \nunderstands and suffices for a lesson for one who does not know. What \nidea do you have, before reaching that end, about how narrow the grave \nis, about the hardship of loneliness, fear of the passage towards the next \nworld, the pangs of fear, the shifting of ribs here and there (due to \nnarrowing of the grave), the deafness of ears, the darkness of the grave, \nthe fear of the promised punishment, the closing of the receptacle of the \ngrave and the laying of the tomb stones? \n \nSo fear Allah, fear Allah, O servants of Allah, because the world \nis behaving with you in the usual way, and you and the Day of Judgement \nare in the same rope (close to each other), as though it has come with its \nsigns, has approached with its pleas and has made you stand in its way. It \nis as though it has come forward with all its quaking and has settled down \nwith its chest on the ground while the world has parted from its people \nand turned them out of its lap. It was like a day that has passed or a month \nthat has gone by. Its new things have become old and the fat ones have \nbecome thin. \n \nThey are in a narrow place, in very complicated affairs and in a \nfire whose pain is intense, the cries are loud, the flames rise [as high as \nmountains], the sound causes a trembling, the burning is severe and \nabatement from all of this is quite remote. Its fuel is burning, its threats \nare fearful, its hollows are hidden, its sides are dark, its vessels are aflame \nand everything about it is abominable. \n“Those who feared (the wrath of) their Master shall be conveyed \nin groups to the Garden” (Holy Quran, 39: 73). They are safe from \nchastisement, away from punishment and are kept aloof from the fire. \nTheir abode will be peaceful, and they will be pleased with their lodging \nand place of stay. These are the people whose deeds in this world were \npure, their eyes were tearful, their nights in this world were like days \nbecause of fearing [Allah], seeking [His] forgiveness, and their days were \nlike nights because of feeling of loneliness and separation. Therefore, \nAllah made Paradise the place of their (eventual) return, a reward in \nrecompense. They were most eligible and suitable for it (Holy Quran, 48: \n26) in the eternal domain and everlasting bliss. \n \nTherefore, O servants of Allah, pay regard to all that by being \nmindful of which one will succeed and by ignoring which one will incur \nloss. Hasten towards your death by means of your (good) deeds because \nyou are bound by what you have done in the past, and you have to your \ncredit only what (good deeds) you have sent before. (Behave in such a \nway) as though the feared event (death) has come upon you, so you \ncannot return (to do good deeds) nor can you be cleared of evil deeds. \nMay Allah prompt us and you to be obedient to Him and to His Prophet \n(h), and may He forgive us and your own selves by His great mercy. \n \nRemain patient during trials and tribulations. Do not move your \nhands and swords after the liking of your tongues, and do not make haste \nin matters in which Allah has not asked for haste: anyone of you who dies \nin his bed while having knowledge of the rights of Allah and the rights of \nHis Prophet (h) and members of the Prophet’s house will die as a martyr. \nHis reward is incumbent on Allah. He is also eligible to the recompense \nof what good deeds he has intended to do, since his intention takes the \nplace of drawing his sword. Certainly, for everything there is a time and a \nlimit."

His forbearance is high, so He \nforgives, and He is just in whatever He decides. He knows what is going \non and what has already passed. He crafted all creation with His \nknowledge and produced it with His intelligence without being limited to \nanything, without learning [from anyone or anything], without following \nthe example of any intelligent producer, without committing any mistake \nand without the availability of any group (for help). I testify that \nMuhammad (k) is His slave and His Messenger whom He deputed (at a \ntime) when people were collecting in the abyss and moving in \nbewilderment. The reins of destruction were dragging them and the locks \nof malice lay fixed on their hearts. \nAdvice about fear of Allah and an account of this world and \nits people\nI admonish you, O servants of Allah,to fear Allah because it is a \nright of Allah over you; it creates your right over Allah, and that you \nshould seek Allah’s help in it and help in (meeting) Allah. Certainly, for \ntoday, fear of Allah is a protection and a shield for tomorrow (the Day of \nJudgement); it is the road to Paradise. Its way is clear and he who treads it \nis the winner. Whoever holds it must safeguards it. It has presented itself \nto the people who have already passed and to those coming into being \nbecause they will need it tomorrow (on the Day of Judgement). It is then \nthat Allah will revive His creation again, take back what He has given and \ntake account of what He has bestowed. How few will be those who accept \nit and practice it as it ought to be practiced! They will be very few in \nnumber; they are the people who fit the description provided by Allah, the \nGlorified One, when He says: “And very few of My creatures are \ngrateful!” (Holy Quran, 34: 13). \n \nSo make haste towards it; intensify your efforts for it. Make it a \nsubstitute for all your past (shortcomings) as a successor. Make it your \nsupporter against every opponent. Turn your sleep into wakefulness by its \nhelp and pass your days in its company. Make it the tool of your hearts, \nwash your sins with it, treat your ailments with it and hasten towards your \ndeath with it... Learn a lesson from him who neglects it, so that others \nwho follow it should not learn a lesson from you (i.e. from your \nneglecting it). Beware, therefore; you should take care of it and should \ntake care of yourselves through it. \n \nKeep away from this world and proceed towards the next with \ninfatuation. Do not regard humbly one whom fear of Allah has given a \nhigh status, and do not accord a high status to him whom this world has \ngiven a high status. Do not keep your eyes on the shining clouds of the \nworld. Do not listen to him who speaks of it, do not respond to him who \ncalls you towards it, do not seek light from its glare and do not die for its \nprecious things because its glitter is deceitful, its words are false, its \nwealth is a liability to be looted, and its precious things are to be taken \naway. \n \nBeware! This world attracts then turns away. It is stubborn, \nrefusing to go ahead. It speaks lies, and it misappropriates. It disowns and \nis ungrateful. It is malicious and abandons (its lovers). It attracts but \ncauses trouble. Its condition is changing, its step shaking, its honor \ndisgraceful, its seriousness a jest and its height is lowliness. It is a place of \nplunder and pillage, ruin and destruction. Its people are ready with their \nfeet to drive, to overtake, then to depart. Its routes are bewildering, its \nexits are baffling and its schemes end in disappointment. Consequently, \nstrongholds betray them, houses throw them out and cunning fails them. \n \nSome of them are like hocked camels, some like butchered meat, \nsome like severed limbs, some like spilt blood, some bite their hands (in \npain), some rub their palms (in remorse), some hold their cheeks on their \nhands (in anxiety), some curse their own views and some retreat from \ntheir determination. But the time for action has gone by, and the hour of \ncalamity has approached. This is so while (there is no longer) time to \nescape (Holy Quran, 38: 3). Alas! Alas! What is been lost is lost! What is \ngone is gone! The world has passed in its usual manner. \n \n“So the heavens and the earth did not mourn them, nor were they \ngiven a respite” (Holy Quran, 44: 29)."

    "text": "Known as “al-Khutbah al-Qasi’a” (the Sermon of \nDisparagement)\nIt comprises a disparagement of Satan [Iblis] for his vanity, his \nrefusal to prostrate before Adam (x), and his being the first to display \nbigotry and behave with vanity. It contains a warning to people treading \nin Satan’s path. \nPraise be to Allah Who wears the apparel of Honor and Dignity \nand has chosen them for Himself rather than for His creation. He has \nmade them inaccessible and unlawful for others. He has selected them for \nHis own great self and has hurled a curse on him who contends with Him \nconcerning them. \nTrial by Allah, Vanity of Iblis\nThen He put His angels on trial concerning these attributes in \norder to distinguish those who were modest from those who were vain. \nTherefore, Allah, Who is aware of whatever is hidden in the hearts and \nwhatever lies behind the unseen, said the following: “Verily, I am about \nto create man from clay. And when I have completed and breathe d into \nhim of My spirit, prostrate to him. And the angels, all of them, did \nprostrate [to Adam] save Iblis” (Holy Quran, 38: 71 - 74). \n \nHis vanity stood in his [Iblis’s] way! Consequently, he felt proud \nabout Adam by virtue of his creation, boasted over him on account of his \norigin. Thus, this enemy of Allah is the leader of those who boast and the \nfore-runner of vanity. It is he who laid the foundation of factionalism, \nquarreled with Allah about the robe of greatness, put on the outfit of \nhaughtiness and took off the covering of humility. Do you not see how \nAllah made him low on account of his vanity and humiliated him for his \nbid to be high? He discarded him in this world and provided for him \nburning fire in the next world. \n \nHad Allah wanted to create Adam from a light whose glare \ndazzles the eyes, whose handsomeness would have amazed the wits and \nwhose smell would have caught the breath, He would have done so. And \nif He had done so, people would have bowed down to him in humility, \nand the trial of the angels through him would have become easier. But \nAllah, the Glorified One, tries His creatures by means of those things the \nreal nature of which they do not know. He does so in order to distinguish \n(what is good from what is bad) for them through the trial, to remove \nvanity from them, and to keep them away from pride and self-admiration. \n \nYou should learn a lesson from what Allah did with Satan. He \nnullified his great deeds and extensive efforts on account of the vanity of \none moment, although Satan had worshipped Allah for six thousand years \n- whether by the reckoning of this world or by that of the next world is not \nknown. Who now can remain safe from Allah after Satan by committing a \nsimilar disobedience? None at all. Allah, the Glorified One, will not let a \nhuman being enter Paradise if he does the same thing for which Allah \nturned an angel from it. His command for the inhabitants in the sky and \nthe earth is the same. There is no friendship between Allah and any \nindividual out of His creation so as to give him license for an undesirable \nthing which He has held unlawful for all the worlds. \nWarning Against Satan\nTherefore, you should fear lest Satan should infect you with his \ndisease or lead you astray through his call or march on you with his \nhorsemen and footmen because, by my life, he has put the arrow in the \nbow for you, has stretched the bow strongly and has aimed at you from a \nnearby distance and: “He (Satan) said the following: Lord! Because You \nlet me stray, certainly will I adorn unto them the path of error, and \ncertainly will I cause them all to go astray” (Holy Quran, 15: 39). \n \nAlthough he (Satan) had said so only by guessing about the \nunknown future and by wrong conjecturing, yet the sons of vanity, the \nbrothers of haughtiness and the horsemen of pride and intolerance proved \nhim to be true, so much so that when disobedient persons from among \nyou bowed before him and his greed about you gained strength, and what \nwas a hidden secret turned into a clear fact..., he spread his full control \nover you and marched with his forces towards you. \n \nThen they pushed you into the hollows of disgrace, threw you \ninto the whirlpools of slaughter and trampled on you, wounding you by \nstriking your eyes with spears, cutting your throats, tearing your nostrils, \nbreaking your limbs and taking you in ropes towards the fire that is \nalready prepared. In this way, he became more harmful to your religion \nand a greater kindler of flames (of mischief) about your worldly matters \nthan the enemies against whom you showed open opposition and against \nwhom you marched with your forces. \n \nYou should, therefore, spend all your force against him and all \nyour efforts confronting him because, by Allah, he boasted over your (i.e. \nAdam’s) origin, questioned your status and spoke lightly of your lineage. \nHe advanced on you with his army and brought his footmen towards your \npath. They are chasing you from every place and they are hitting you at \nevery finger joint. You are not able to defend by any means, nor can you \nrepulse them by any effort. You are in the thick of disgrace, the ring of \nstraitness, the field of death and the way of distress. \n \nYou should, therefore, put out the fires of haughtiness and the \nflames of intolerance that are hidden in your hearts. This vanity can exist \nin a Muslim only through the insinuations of Satan, his haughtiness, \nmischief and whisperings. Make up your mind to be humble, to trample \non egotism and self-pride and to cast off vanity. Adopt humility as the \nweapon with which you fight your enemies, Satan and his forces. He \ncertainly has, from every people, fighters, helpers, footmen and horsemen. \nDo not be like him who feigned superiority over the son of his own \nmother without any distinction given to him by Allah except the feeling of \nenvy which his feeling of greatness created in him and the fire of anger \nthat vanity kindled in his heart. Satan blew into his nose his own vanity \nfollowing which Allah gave him remorse and made him responsible for \nthe sins of all killers up to the Day of Judgement. \nCautioning Against Vanity and Ignorant Boasting\nBeware! You strove hard in rebellioning and created mischief on \nearth in open opposition to Allah, challenging the believers over fighting. \n(You should fear) Allah in feeling proud; beware of your vanity and \nignorant boasting over because this is the root of enmity and the design of \nSatan whereby he has been deceiving past people and bygone ages, with \nthe result that they fell into the gloom of his ignorance and the hollows of \nhis misguidance, submitting to his driving and accepting his leadership. In \nthis matter, the hearts of all the people were similar. Centuries passed by, \none after the other, in the same way, and there was vanity with which \nchests were tightened. \nCautioning Against Obeying Haughty Leaders and Elders\nBeware! Beware of obeying your leaders and elders who feel \nproud of their achievements and boast about their lineage. They hurled the \n(liability for) things on Allah and quarreled with Him regarding what He \ndid with them, contesting His decree and disputing His favors. Certainly, \nthey are themain foundation of obstinacy, the chief pillars of mischief and \nthe swords of pre-Islamic boasting over fore-fathers. Therefore, fear \nAllah, do not become antagonistic to His favors on you, nor jealous of His \nbounty over you and do not obey the claimants (of Islam) whose dirty \nwater you drink along with your clean one, whose ailments you mix with \nyour healthiness and whose wrongs you allow to enter into your rightful \nmatters.\n \nThey are the foundation of vice and the linings of disobedience. \nSatan has made them carriers of misguidance and the soldiers with whom \nhe assaults men. They are interpreters through whom he speaks in order to \nsteal away your wits, enter into your eyes and blow into your ears. In this \nway, he makes you the victim of his arrows, the treading ground of his \nfootsteps and source of strength for his hands. Learn from how he brought \nwrath, violence, chastisement and punishment on those who were vain \nfrom among the past people. Take admonition from their lying on their \ncheeks and falling on their sides and seek Allah’s protection from the \ndangers of vanity, as you seek His protection from calamities. \nHumbleness of the Holy Prophet (h)\nCertainly, if Allah were to allow anyone to indulge in pride, He \nwill have allowed it to His selected prophets and vicegerents. But Allah, \nthe Sublime, disliked vanity for them and likes to see them humble. \nTherefore, they laid their cheeks on the ground, smeared their faces with \nthe dust, bent down for the believers and remained humble. Allah tried \nthem with hunger, afflicted them with difficulty, tested them with fear and \nupset them with troubles. Therefore, do not regard wealth and progeny as \nthe criterion for Allah’s pleasure and displeasure, as you are not aware of \nthe chances of mischief and trials during richness and power as Allah, the \nGlorified One, the Sublime, has said the following: “What?! Do they \nthink that what We aid them with wealth and children that We are \nhastening to them the good things? Nay! They (only) do not perceive it” \n(Holy Quran, 23: 55-56). \n \nCertainly, Allah, the most Glorified One, tries His beings who are \nvain through His beloved persons who are humble in their eyes. \n \nWhen Musa son of Imran went to Pharaoh along with his brother \nHarun (Aaron) wearing (coarse) shirts of wool and holding canes in their \nhands, they guaranteed him retention of his country and continuity of his \nprestige only if he submitted. But he said the following: “Do you not \nwonder at these two men guaranteeing me the continuity of my prestige \nand the retention of my country although you see their poverty and \nlowliness?! Otherwise, why do they not have gold bangles on their \nwrists?!” He said so feeling proud of his gold and collected possessions \nand considering wool and its cloth as nothing. \n \nAllah, the Glorified One, deputed His prophets to mankind. If He \nhad wished to open for them treasures and mines of gold and (surround \nthem with) planted gardens and collect around them the birds of the skies \nand the beasts of the earth, He could have done so. Had He had done so, \nthere would have been no trial, nor recompense and no tidings (about the \naffairs of the next life). Those who accepted (His message) could not be \ngiven the recompense due after trial, and the believers could not deserve \nthe reward for good deeds, and all these words will not have retained their \nmeanings. But Allah, the Glorified One, makes His Prophets firm in their \ndetermination and gives them weakness of appearance as seen by the \neyes, along with contentment that fills the hearts and eyes resulting from \ncare-freeness and with want that pains the eyes and the ears. \n \nHad the prophets possessed authority that could not be assaulted, \nor honor that could not be touched with harm or domain towards which \nthenecks of people would turn and the saddles of mounts could be set, it \nwill have been very easy for people to seek lessons and quite difficult to \nfeel vain. They will have then accepted belief out of fear felt by them or \ninclination attracting them and their intention will have been the same, \nalthough their actions will have been different. Therefore, Allah, the \nGlorified One, decided that people should follow His prophets, \nacknowledge His books, remain humble before His Greatness, act upon \nHis commands and accept His obedience with sincerity in which there \nshould not be an iota of anything else. As the trial and tribulation will be \nstiffer, the reward and recompense, too, should be greater. \nThe Holy Ka`ba\nDo you not see that Allah, the Glorified One, has tried all the \npeople who came with Adam, up to the last ones in this world, with stones \nwhich yield neither benefit nor harm, which neither see nor hear? [Yet] \nHe made those stones into His sacred House which He made as a place of \nworship for people. He placed it in the most rugged stony part of the \nearth, on a highland with the least soil, among the most narrow valleys \nbetween rough mountains, soft sandy plains, springs of scanty water and \nscattered inhabitants, where neither camels nor horses nor cows nor sheep \ncan prosper. \n \nThen He commanded Adam and his sons to turn towards it. In \nthis way, it became the center of their journey in seeking pasture, the \nrendezvous for the meeting of their beasts of burden, so that human spirits \nwould hasten towards it from distant waterless deserts, deep and low lying \nvalleys and scattered islands in the seas. They shake their shoulders in \nhumbleness, recite the slogan of having reached His audience, march with \nswift feet and have disheveled hair and dusted faces. They throw their \npieces of cloth on their backs. They have marred the beauty of their faces \nby leaving the hair uncut as a matter of great test, severe tribulation, open \ntrial and extreme refining. Allah has made it a means to His mercy and an \napproach to His Paradise. \n \nIf Allah, the Glorified One, had placed His sacred House and His \ngreat signs among plantations, streams, soft and level plains, plenty of \ntrees, an abundance of fruits, a thick population, close habitats, golden \nwheat, lush gardens, green land, watered plains, thriving orchards and \ncrowded streets..., the amount of recompense will have decreased because \nof the lightness of the trial. If the foundation on which the House is built \nand the stones with which it has been raised had been of green emerald \nand red rubies, and had therebeen brightness and glory, then this will have \nlessened the action of doubts in the breasts, will have dismissed the effect \nof Satan’s activity from the hearts and will have stopped the surging of \nmisgivings in people. But Allah tries His servants with means of different \ntroubles. He wants them to render worship through hardship and involves \nthem in distress, all in order to extract vanity from their hearts, to settle \ndown humbleness in their spirits and to make all this an open door for His \nfavors and an easy means for His forgiveness (of their sins). \nCautioning Against Rebellion and Oppressiveness\n (Fear) Allah from the immediate consequence of rebellion and \nthe eventual consequence of weighty oppressiveness (to accrue in the next \nworld) and from the evil result of vanity. Vanity is the great trap of Satan \nand his big deceit which enters the hearts of the people as fatal poison \ndoes. It is never wasted, nor does ti miss anyone, neither the learned on \naccount of their knowledge, nor the destitute in their rags. This is the \nthing against which Allah has protected His believing servants by means \nof prayers and alms-giving and suffering the hardship of fasting in the \ndays in which it has been made obligatory, in order to provide their limbs \nwith peacefulness, to cast fear in their eyes, to humble their spirits, to give \ntheir hearts humility and to remove haughtiness from them. All this is \nachieved through the covering of their delicate cheeks with dust in \nhumility, prostrating their limbs on the ground in humbleness and \nretracting their bellies so as to reach to their backs due to fasting by way \nof lowliness (before Allah), besides giving all sorts of products of the \nearth to the needy and the destitute by way of alms. \n \nLook what these deeds contain of curbing the appearance of pride \nand suppressing the traces of vanity. I cast my glance and noticed that no \none in the world, except you, feel vanity for anything without a cause \nwhich may appeal to the ignorant, or a reason which may cling to \ntheminds of the fools because you feel vanity for something for which no \nreason is discernable, nor any ground. \n \nAs for Satan, he felt proud about Adam because of his origin and \ntaunted at him about his creation. He said, “I am created of [smokeless] \nfire whereas you are created of clay.” Likewise, the rich among the \nprosperous communities have been feeling vanity because of their riches, \nas (Allah) said the following: ‘And they said, ‘We are more (than you) in \nwealth and in children, and we shall not be chastised’” (Holy Quran, 34: \n35).\nEnthusiasm for Attractive Manners, Respectable Status and \nTaking Lessons from the Past\nIn case you cannot avoid vanity, your vanity should be for good \nqualities, praiseworthy deeds and admirable merits with which the \ndignified and noble chiefs of the Arab families distinguished themselves. \nSuch merits include attractive manners, high thinking, respectable status \nand commendable feats. You, too, should show vanity in praiseworthy \nhabits like protection of the neighbor, fulfillment of agreements, \nobedience of the virtuous, opposition to the haughty, extending generosity \nto others, abstention from dissension, keeping aloof from bloodshed, \ndoing justice to people, suppressing anger and avoiding trouble on earth. \nYou should also fear what calamities befell nations before you on account \nof their evil deeds and detestable conduct. Remember, during good or bad \ntimes, what happened to them and be cautious lest you should become \nlike them. \n \nAfter you have thought over the conditions of these people, attach \nyourself to everything with which their status became honorable, on \naccount of which enemies kept away from them, thus safety spread over \nthem, by reason of which riches bowed before them and, as a result, \ndistinction connected itself to their rope. These things were: abstention \nfrom division, sticking to unity, calling each other to it and advising each \nother about it. You should avoid everything which broke those nations’ \nbackbone and weakened their power, such as malice in the heart, hatred in \nthe chest, turning away (from each other’s help) and abstaining from one \nanother’s assistance. \n \nThink about the condition of people from among the believers \nwho passed by before you. What distresses and trials they were in! Were \nthey not the most over-burdened among all the people and in the most \nstrained circumstances in the whole world? The Pharaohs took them as \nslaves. They inflicted on them the worst punishments and bitter \nsufferings. They continuously remained in this state of ruinous disgrace \nand severe subjugation. They found no method for escape and no way for \nprotection. Allah, the Glorified One, noticed that they were enduring \ntroubles in His love and bearing distresses out of fear of Him, He \nprovided escape routes from the distress of trials. So, He changed their \ndisgrace into honor and fear into safety. Consequently, they became \nruling kings and conspicuous leaders. Allah’s favors over them reached \nlimits to which their own wishes had not reached. \n \nSee how they were when their groups were united, their views \nwere unanimous, their hearts were moderate, their hands used to help one \nanother, their swords were intended for assisting one another, their visions \nwere sharp, and their aims were uniform. Did they not become masters of \nthe corners of earth and rulers over the necks of all the worlds? \nThereafter, also see what happened to them towards the end when \ndivision overtook them, unity became fractured and differences arose \nbetween their words and hearts. They divided into various groups and \nwere scattered fighting among themselves. Then Allah took away from \nthem the apparel of His honor and deprived them of the prosperity \nproduced by His favors. Only their stories have remained among you for \nthe guidance of those who may learn lessons from them. \n \nYou should learn a lesson from the fate of the progeny of Isma’il, \nthe children of Isaac and the children of Israel. How similar their affairs \nand how akin their examples are! With regard to the details of their \ndivision and disunity, think of the days when Kisras of Persia and the \nCaesars of Rome had become their masters. They turned them out of their \npastures, the rivers of Iraq and the fertility of the world, towards thorny \nforests, the passages of (hot) winds and hardships in livelihood. In this \nway, they turned them into just camel herders. Their houses were the \nworst in the world and their places of stay were the most drought-stricken. \nThere was not one single voice towards which they could turn for \nprotection, nor any shade of affection on whose strength they could place \ntheir trust. \n \nTheir condition was full of distress. Their energies were scattered. \nThey were mostly divided, disunited. They were in great anguish and in \npathetic ignorance. They buried their daughters alive, worshipped idols, \ndisregarded kinship and practiced robbery. \n \nNow, look at the various favors of Allah upon them! He deputed \nto them a Prophet (k) who got them to pledge their obedience to him and \nmade them unite under his call. (Look) how (Allah’s) bounty spread the \nwings of its favors over them and streams of its blessing flowed for them; \nthe whole community became wrapped in blissful prosperity. \nConsequently, they were submerged under its bounty and enjoyed its lush \nlife. Their affairs were settled under the protection of a powerful ruler. \nCircumstances offered them lofty honor, and all things became easy for \nthem within one united and strong country. They became rulers over the \nworld and kings in the (various) parts of earth. They became masters of \nthose who were formerly their masters and began issuing commands over \nthose who used to command them. They were so strong that neither their \nspears needed testing nor did their weapons have any flaw. \nCondemning His People\nBeware! You have shaken your hands loose from the rope of \nobedience and broken the Divine fort around you by (resorting to) \njahili (pre-Islamic) customs. Certainly, it is a great blessing of \nAllah, the Glorified One, that He has promoted among them unity through \nthe cord of affection in whose shade they walk and are sheltered. This is a \nblessing the value of which none in the whole world realizes because it is \nmore valuable than any price and more precious than any material wealth. \n \nYou should know that you have again reverted to the status of \nbedouin Arabs after migration (to Islam) and have become different \nparties after having been once united. You do not possess anything of \nIslam except its name and know nothing of belief except its outer cover. \nYou say, “The Fire, yes, but no shameful status,” as if you will throw \ndown Islam on its face in order to defame its honor and break its pledge \n(of brotherhood) which Allah gave you as a sacred trust on His earth and \n(a source of) peace among the people. Rest assured that if you incline \ntowards anything other than Islam, the unbelievers will fight you. Then \nthere will be neither Gabriel nor Michael, neither Muhajirun nor Ansar to \nhelp you, only the clashing of swords, till Allah settles the matter for you. \n \nCertainly, there are examples before you of Allah’s wrath, \npunishment, days of tribulations and serious events. Therefore, do not \ndisregard His promises, ignoring His punishment, underestimating His \nwrath and not expecting His violence. Allah, the Glorified One, did not \ncurse the past generations except because they had forsaken enjoining \nothers to do good deeds and to refrain from doing bad deeds. In fact, \nAllah cursed the foolish ones for committing sins and the wise for giving \nup on curbing others from committing evil deeds. Beware! You have \nbroken the shackles of Islam, transgressed its limits and destroyed its \ncommands. \nImam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s High Status and Wonderful Deeds \nin Islam\nBeware! Surely Allah has commanded me to fight those who \nrebellion or break their pledge or create trouble in the land. As regarding \npledge-breakers, I have fought them. As regarding those who shrunk from \nthe truth, I have waged a holy war against them. And as regarding those \nwho have abandoned the creed, I have put them in (serious) disgrace. As \nfor Satan of the Pit, he, too, has been dealt with by me through the loud \ncry with which the scream of his heart and shaking of his chest was also \nheard. Only a small portion of the rebels has remained. If Allah allows me \none more chance over them I will annihilate them except a few remnants \nthat may remain scattered in the suburb of the cities. \n \nEven in my boyhood, I had lowered the chest of (famous men) of \nArabia and broken the horn points (i.e. defeated the chiefs) of the tribes of \nRabi`ah and Mudar. Certainly, you know my status of close kinship and \nspecial relationship with the Prophet of Allah (k). When I was only a \nchild, he took charge of me. He used to press me to his chest and put me \nbeside him in his bed, bringing his body close to mine and letting me \nsmell his fragrance. He used to chew something then feed me with it. He \nfound no lie in my speech, nor weakness in any deeds. \n \nFrom the time of my weaning, Allah had put a mighty angel with \nthe Prophet (k) to take him along the path of high character and good \nbehavior through the day and the night, while I used to follow him like a \nyoung camel following in the footprints of its mother. Every day, he \nwould show me in the form of a banner some of his high traits, \ncommanding me to follow it. Every year he used to go in seclusion to the \nhill of Hira’, where I saw him but no one else saw him. In those days, \nIslam was not recognized in any house except that of the Prophet of Allah \n(k) and Khadija, while I was the third after these two. I used to see and \nwatch the glory of the Divine revelation and message, and I breathed the \nscent of Prophethood. \n \nWhen the revelation descended on the Prophet of Allah (k), I \nheard the moan of Satan. I said, “O Prophet of Allah! What is this \nmoaning?” He replied, “This is Satan who has lost all hope of being \nworshipped. O Ali! You see all that I see and hear all that I hear, except \nthat you are not a prophet; you are a vicegerent and you are surely on (the \npath of) virtue.” \nI was with him when a party of the tribesmen of Quraish came to \nhim and said, “O Muhammad! You have made a big claim which none of \nyour forefathers or those of your family has made. We ask you one thing; \nif you give us an answer to it and show it to us, we will believe that you \nare a prophet and a messenger, but if you cannot do it, we will know that \nyou are a sorcerer and a liar.” The Messenger of Allah said the following: \n“What do you ask for?” They said, “Ask this tree to move towards us, \neven with its roots and stop before you.” The Prophet (h) said, “Verily, \nAllah has power over everything. If Allah does it for you, will you then \nbelieve and testify to the truth?” They said, “Yes.” Then he said, “I shall \nshow you whatever you want, but I know that you will not bend towards \nvirtue, and there are among you those who will be thrown into the pit and \nthose who will form parties (against me).” Then the Holy Prophet (h)\nsaid the following: “O tree! If you do believe in Allah and in the Day of \nJudgement and know that I am the Prophet of Allah, come up with your \nroots and stand before me with the permission of Allah.” By the One Who \ndeputed the Prophet (h) with the truth, the tree did remove itself with its \nroots and came with a great humming sound and a flapping like the \nflapping of the wings of birds, till it stopped before the Messenger of \nAllah while some of its twigs came down onto my shoulders and I was on \nthe right side of the Holy Prophet (h).\n \nWhen the people saw this, they said by way of pride and vanity, \n‘Now you order half of it to come to you and the other half of it to remain \n(in its place).” The Holy Prophet (h) ordered the tree to do the same. \nHalf of the tree advanced towards him in an amazing manner and with a \ngrater humming. It was about to touch the Prophet of Allah (k). Then \nthey said in their disbelief and rebellion, “Ask this half to get back to its \nother half and be as it was.” The Prophet (h) ordered it and it returned. \nThen I said, “O Prophet of Allah! I am the first to believe in you and to \nacknowledge that the tree did what it did just now with the command of \nAllah, the Sublime One, in testimony to your Prophethood and to \nstrengthen your word.” Upon this all the people shouted, ‘Rather a \nsorcerer, a liar, you are! This is wonderful sorcery! He is very adept in it. \nOnly a youth like this (pointing to me) can stand testimony to you in your \naffairs.”\n \nCertainly, I belong to the group of people who care not for the \nreproach of anybody in matters concerning Allah. Their countenance is \nthe countenance of the truthful and their speech is the speech of the \nvirtuous. They are wakeful during the nights (in devotion to Allah) and \nover beacons (of guidance) in the day. They hold fast to the rope of the \nHoly Quran, revive the traditions of Allah and of His Prophet (h). They \ndo not boast nor indulge in self-conceit, nor misappropriate, nor create \nmischief. Their hearts are in Paradise while their bodies are busy in \n(good) deeds. \n \nThe intention above is: “You should not create conditions \nbecause of which you may be deprived of Allah’s favors, like the jealous \nwho aims at harming one of whom he is jealous.” \n \nThere is also the intention above that if belief is accepted by \nforce, and if worship is offered under pressure by some power or \nauthority, neither will it be belief in the true sense nor worship in the real \nspirit. This is so because belief is an inner testimony and a heartfelt \nconviction. The conviction produced by force and compulsion can only be \nverbal, not heartfelt. Similarly, worship is the name of open \nacknowledgment of one’s status of servitude. Worship devoid of the \nfeeling of servitude or the sense of devotion performed only out of fear \ncannot be real worship. Therefore, such belief and such worship will not \npresent their correct connotation. \n \nThe reason for the Imam (x) specifying the learned and the poor, \nas indicated above, is that the learned person has the light of learning to \nlead him. The destitution of the poor may be a hindrance. In spite of this, \nboth the learned and the poor may fall prey to one’s deceit. \n \nHow can the ignorant person save himself from Satan’s clutches, \nand how can the rich person, who has all the means to get into wrong \nways, defend himself against him? \n \nNay! Verily man is wont to rebel! \n \nAs he deems himself needless! \n \nIf a glance is cast at the rise and fall as well as the events of the \npast nations, this fact will shine like daylight: The rise and fall of \ncommunities is not the result of luck or change. To a great extent, it is \naffected by their actions. Whatever type those actions may be, their \noutcomes and consequences are in accord with them. Consequently, the \nstories and events of past peoples openly reflect the fact that the result of \noppression and evil deeds has always been ruin and destruction, while the \nconsequence of a virtuous action and peaceful living was always good \nfortune and success. Since time immemorial, people make no difference, \nif the same conditions appear again and again, the same actions are \nrepeated, the same results must accrue which had appeared in the earlier \nset of circumstances. The accrual of the results of good or bad actions is \nsure and certain like the properties and effects of everything. If this were \nnot so, it would not be possible to kindle hope in the minds of the \noppressed and the afflicted by presenting to them past events and their \nrespective effects, nor could the oppressors and tyrants be warned of the \nill effects of their own misdeeds on the ground that it was not necessary \nthat the same will accrue now as had accrued before. But it is the \nuniversality of causes which makes past events the object of a lesson for \nposterity. Consequently, it was for this purpose that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) provoked thinking and consideration, stating the various events \nof Banu Isma’il, Banu Ishaq and Banu Isra’il and their being afflicted at \nthe hands of the kings of Persia and Rome. \n \nThe progeny of Isma’il, the elder son of Ibrahim (Abraham), is \ncalled Banu Isma’il, while the progeny of his younger son, Isaac, is called \nBanu Ishaq which later continued to divide into various off-shoots and \nacquired different names. Their original abode was at Canaan, Palestine, \nwhere Ibrahim had settled after the migration from the plains of the \nEuphrates and the Tigris. His son Isma’il had settled in Hijaz, where \nIbrahim had left him and his mother Hajar (Hagar). Isma’il married \nSayyidah daughter of Mudad, a woman from the tribe of Jurhum which \nalso inhabited this area. His progeny sprang from her and spread \nelsewhere. The other son of Ibrahim, namely Ishaq, remained in Canaan. \nHis son was Ya`qub (Jacob, or Israel) who married Liya the daughter of \nhis maternal uncle brother and after her death married his uncle’s other \ndaughter. Both of them bore his progeny which is known as Banu Isra’il. \nOne of his sons was Yusuf (Joseph) who reached the neighboring country, \nEgypt, through an accident and, after suffering slavery and imprisonment, \neventually he won a high position in the then government of a just \nEgyptian king. \n \nAfter this change, Yusuf sent for all his family and relatives to \njoin him. Thus, Egypt became the new abode of Banu Isra’il. For some \ntime, they lived there in peace and security, leading a respectable life. But \nby and by, the locals began to view them with disdain and hatred, making \nthem the target of all sorts of tyrannies, so much so that they used to kill \ntheir children and let their women live as their bondmaids, as a result of \nwhich their determination and courage were trampled upon, their spirit of \nfreedom was completely subdued. At last, conditions changed and the \nperiod of their troubles came to an end after four hundred years of the \nshackles of slavery. This happened when Allah sent Musa to deliver them \nfrom the oppression of Pharaoh. Musa set off with them to leave Egypt. In \norder to destroy Pharaoh, Allah turned them towards the Nile. Thus, the \nmighty river was in front and behind them were the huge forces of \nPharaoh. This terrified them a great deal, but Allah commanded Musa to \nstrike the river with his cane, causing a dry pathway therein. Thus, when \nhe advanced, there appeared in the river not only one but several courses \nto pass through. Musa crossed to the other side of the river along with \nBanu Isra’il. Pharaoh was closely following. When he saw them passing, \nhe, too, advanced with his army. But when they reached the middle of the \nNile, the water engulfed Pharaoh and his army in its waves, finishing \nthem. About them, the Holy Quran says the following: “And (remember) \nwhen We delivered you from Pharaoh’s people who afflicted you with \ngrievous torment, slaying your sons and letting your women live, and in \nthat there was a great trial from your Master” (2: 49). \n \nHaving left the boundaries of Egypt, they entered their \nmotherland, Palestine, established their own state and began to live in \nfreedom. Allah changed their lowliness and disgrace into the greatness \nand sublimity of rule and power. In this regard, Allah says the following: \n \n“And We made the people who were deemed weak inherit the \neastern parts of the earth and the western parts of it which we had blessed \nthe rein (with fertility), and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in \nthe children of Israel for what they did endure, and We destroyed what \nPharaoh and his people had wrought and what shade they made” (Holy \nQuran, 7: 137). \n \nOn gaining power and regaining prosperity and security, Banu \nIsra’il forgot all the ignominy and disgrace of the period of slavery. \nInstead of being thankful to Allah for the favors which He granted them, \nthey took to rebellion and rebellion. Consequently, they shamelessly \nindulged in vices and misconduct, partaking in mischief and evil deeds to \nthe maximum. They made lawful things which are unlawful and vice \nversa by false excuses. They disobeyed the prophets who tried to preach \nand correct them under the command of Allah and even killed them. The \nnatural consequence of their vicious activities was that they were caught \nin punishment for their deeds. Nebuchadnezzar, who was ruling Babylon \n(in nowadays’ Iraq) in 600 B.C. rose to power against Syria and Palestine \nand killed seventy thousand of Banu Isra’il with his blood-thirsty swords. \nHe devastated their towns, drove away the survivors with him like sheep \nand goats and threw them in the abyss of ignominy by turning them into \nslaves. Although after this ruination there seemed no way for them to \nregain status and power, nature gave them still another chance to recover. \nWhen Nebuchadnezzar died and power came in the hands of Belshazzar, \none of their own, the latter started all sorts of oppression on the people. \nBeing disgusted with this, they sent word to the ruler of Persia that they \nwere tired of enduring the oppression of their ruler and that he should \nrescue them from him and free them from the oppression of Belshazzar. \nCyrus the Great, who was a just and upright ruler, rose up in response to \nthis request and, with the cooperation of the local population, overturned \nthe government, as a consequence of which the yoke of slavery on the \nnecks of Banu Isra’il was also removed, and they were allowed to return \nto Palestine. Thus, after seventy years of subjugation, they again set foot \nin their homeland and took over the reins of government. If they had \ntaken their lesson from the past events, they would not have committed \nthe same evils as a consequence of which they had to suffer slavery. But \nthe mental constitution of his community was such that whenever they \nachieved of prosperity and freedom from care, they lost themselves in the \nintoxication of riches and in the enjoyment of pleasure, mocked the laws \nof religion, derided the prophets and even killed them; all these vices did \nnot mean anything to them. Thus, when their ruler, Herod, at the request \nof his sweetheart [Shalomy], beheaded Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist) \nand presented his head to her, none of them raised any voice against this \nbrutality or was affected by it in any manner. This was the state of their \nunruliness and fierce nature when Isa made his appearance. He stopped \nthem from committing evil deeds and exhorted them to adopt good \ncustoms, but they opposed him, too, and gave him troubles of various \nsorts, so much so that they even tried to end his life. However, Allah \nfoiled all their plots and made Isa safe against their mischief. When their \ndisobedience reached this stage and their capacity to accept guidance was \ncompletely wiped out, fate decided to ruin them and make full \narrangements for their annihilation and destruction. The ruler of \nByzantine Rome, Vespasianus, sent his son, Titus, to attack Syria. He laid \na siege around Jerusalem, demolished houses and broke down the walls of \nthe synagogues as a result of which thousands of Banu Isra’il left their \nhomes and became scattered abroad, while thousands died of hunger. \nThose who remained were put to death. Most of them settled in Hijaz. \nBecause of their rejection of Prophet Muhammad (h), their unity was so \ndisturbed that they could never again converge on any one center of honor \nand could never regain a life of prestige and dignity in place of disgrace \nand ignominy. \n \nIn the same way, the ruler of then Persia made serious attacks on \nArabia and subjugated the inhabitants of those areas. Thus, Shahpur son \nof Hormuz, at the age of sixteen, took with him four thousand combatants \nand attacked the Arabs who resided within the boundaries of Persia then \nadvanced towards Bahrain, Qatif and Hajar and ruined Banu Tamim, \nBanu Bakr ibn Wa’il and Banu Abdul-Qays, cutting through the shoulders \nof seventy thousand Arabs, earning the nickname “Dhul-Aktaf” (the man \nof the shoulders). He forced the Arabs to live in tents of woven animal \nhair, grow long hair on their heads, not wear white clothes and ride \nunsaddled horses. Then he settled twelve thousand people of Isfahan and \nother cities of Peria in the area between Iraq and Syria. In this way, he \ndrove the inhabitants of those areas from fertile lands to waterless forests \nwhich had neither conveniences of life nor means of livelihood. For long, \nthese people remained the victims of others’ oppression due to their own \ndisunity and division. At last, Allah deputed the Prophet (h) and raised \nthem out of disgrace to the highest pinnacle of progress and sublimity. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Jabir ibn \nAbdullah al-Ansari, Abdullah ibn Mas`ud, `Ammar ibn Yasir, Abu Sa’id \nal-Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas narrated that the Holy Prophet (h)\ncommanded Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to fight those who were pledge-\nbreakers (nakithin), deviators from truth (qasitin) and those who had \nreneged from the faith (mariqin). See the following references for this \nfact: Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 139; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1117; Usd al-\nGhaba, Vol. 3, pp. 32-33; Al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. 6, p. 18; Al-Khasa’is \nal-Kubra, Vol. 2, p. 138; Majma’ al-Zawa’id, Vol. 5, p. 186; Vol. 6, p. \n235; \nVol. \n7, \np. \n238; \nKanz \nal-Ummal, \nVol. \n6, \npp. \n72,82,88,155,215,319,391,392; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 8, p. 340; Vol. 13, \npp. 186-187; Tarikh, Ibn Asakir, Vol. 5, p. 41; Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 7, \npp. 304-306; Al-Riyad al-Nadira, Vol. 2, p. 240; Sharh al-Mawahib al-\nLadunniyya, Vol. 3, pp. 316-317; Sharh al-Mawaddat al-Awham, Vol. 1, \np. 386). \n \nIbn Abul-Hadid says, “It has been proven (by right ascription) \nfrom the Holy Prophet (h) that he said the following to Ali (x): “You \nwill fight after me those who are pledge-breakers, deviators from the truth \nand those who have gone out of the faith.” \n \nThe pledge-breakers were the people of Jamal because they broke \ntheir allegiance to him. The deviators from the truth were the people of \nSyria at Siffin. Those who reneged from the faith were the Kharijites at \nan-Nahrawan. Regarding these three groups, Allah says (about the first \none): “Verily, those who swear their fealty to you do swear fealty to \nAllah; the hand of Allah is above their hands; so, whosoever violates his \noath violates it only to the harm of his (own) self” (Holy Quran, 48: 10). \nAbout the second group Allah says the following: “As for the deviators, \nthey shall be the fuel of hell” (Holy Quran, 72: 15). Concerning the third \ngroup, Ibn Abul-Hadid has referred to the following tradition (hadith) that \nal-Bukhari (in Sahih, Vol. 4, pp.166-167, 243), Muslim (in Sahih, Vol. 3, \npp. 109-117), al-Tirmidhi (in Jami’al-Sihah, Vol. 4, p. 481), Ibn Majah (in \nAl-Sunan, Vol. 1, pp. 59-62), al-Nisa’i (in Al-Sunan, Vol. 3, pp. 65-66), \nMalik ibn Anas (in Al-Muwatta’, pp. 204-205), al-Dar Qutni (in Al-\nSunan, Vol. 3, pp. 131-132), ad-Darmi (in Al-Sunan, Vol. 2, p. 133), Abu \nDawud (in Al-Sunan, Vol. 4 pp.241-246), al-Hakim (in Al-Mustadrak, \nVol. 2, pp. 145-154; Vol. 4, p.531), Ahmed ibn Hanbal (in Al-Musnad, \nVol. 1, pp. 88,140,147; Vol. 3, pp.56,65) and al-Bayhaqi (in Al-Sunan al-\nKubra, Vol. 8, pp.170-171) have narrated through a group of the \ncompanions of the Holy Prophet (h) that he said the following about \nDhul-Khuwaysira (the surname for hu’th-Thudayyah Hurqus ibn Zuhayr \nat-Tamimi, the chief of the Kharijites): “From this very person’s posterity, \nthere will rise people who will recite the Holy Quran, but it will not go \nbeyond their throat; they will kill the followers of Islam and will spare the \nidol-worshippers. They will glance through the teachings of Islam as \nhurriedly as the arrow passes through its prey. If I were to ever find them, \nI would kill them like Ad.” \n \nThen ibn Abul-Hadid goes on to say the following: “This is the \nsign for his (Holy Prophet’s) Prophethood and prediction of the secret \nknowledge (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 13, p.183). \n \nThere is a reference above to “satan of the pit”. This is a reference \nto Dhu’t-Thudayyah (whose full name is already mentioned in a footnote \nabove) who was killed during the battle of Nahrawan by the stroke of \nlightning from the sky, so there was no need to kill him by the sword. The \nHoly Prophet (h) had predicted the way how he would die. Therefore, \nafter the annihilation of the Kharijites at Nahrawan, Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) came out in hot pursuit but could not find his body anywhere. In \nthe meantime, ar-Rayyan ibn Sabirah saw forty to fifty bodies in a pit on \nthe bank of the Nahrawan canal. When they were taken out [to be \nidentified], the body of Dhul-Thudayya was found among them. He was \ncalled Dhul-Thudayya because of a mass of flesh on his shoulder [which \nlooked like a small breast]. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saw the \nman’s body, he said, “Allah is Great! Neither I spoke a lie nor was I told \nwrong” (Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 13, pp. 183-184; al-Tabari, Vol. 1, pp.3383 \n- 3384; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, p.348)."

    "title": "Sermon 192",
    "text": "It is related that a companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\ncalled Hamman188, who was a man devoted to worship, and said to \nhim, “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib! Describe to me the pious men in \nsuch a way as though I see them.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) replied \nsaying: “Hamman! Fear Allah and do good deeds because “Verily, Allah \nis\nwith those who guard (themselves against evil) and those who do \ngood (to others)” (Holy Quran, 16: 128). But Hamman was not satisfied \nwith this answer and pressured the Imam to provide more details. \nThereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) praised Allah and extolled Him \nand sought His blessings on the Holy Prophet (h) then said the \nfollowing:\n \nAllah, the most Glorified One, the Sublime, created everything \nand everyone. He created them without any need for their obedience. The \nsin of any sinner does not harm Him, nor does the obedience of anyone \nwho obeys Him benefit Him. He has distributed among them their \nlivelihood and has assigned for them their positions in the world. \n \nThus, the God-fearing, in this world are the people of distinction. \nTheir speech is to the point, their clothing is moderate and their gait is \nhumble. They keep their eyes closed to what Allah has made unlawful for \nthem, and they put listen to the knowledge which is beneficial to them. \nThey remain calm during the time of trials. If there had not been fixed \nperiods (of life) ordained for each one of them, their spirits would not \nhave remained in their bodies even for the twinkling of an eye because of \n(their) eagerness for the reward [awaiting them in the Hereafter] and fear \nof chastisement. The greatness of the Creator is seated in their heart and; \nso, everything else appears small in their eyes. Thus, to them, Paradise is \nas though they see it and are enjoying its bliss. To them, Hell is also as if \nthey see it and are suffering from its punishment. \n \nTheir hearts are grieved, they are protected against evils, their \nbodies are thin, their needs are scanty and their souls are chaste. They \nendure (hardship) for a short while; consequently, they secure comfort for \na long time. It is a beneficial transaction that Allah made easy for them. \n \n188 According to ibn Abul-Hadid, this is a reference to Hamman ibn \nShurayh, but allama al-Majlisi says that apparently this is Hamman ibn Abadah. \nThe world wants them, but they do not want it. It captured them, but they \nfreed themselves from it with a ransom. \n \nDuring the night, they are up standing on their feet reading \nportions of the Holy Quran and reciting it in a well-measured way, \ncreating through it grief for themselves and seeking by it the cure for their \nailments. If they come across a verse which creates eagerness (for \nParadise), they pursue it avidly, and their spirits turn towards it eagerly, \nand they feel as if it is in front of them. And when they come across a \nverse which inspires fear (of Hell), they bend the ears of their hearts \ntowards it and feel as though the sound of Hell and its cries are reaching \ntheir ears. They bend their backs, prostrate on their foreheads, palms, \nknees and toes, beseeching Allah, the Sublime, for their deliverance. \nDuring the day, they endure, learn and remain virtuous and God-fearing. \nFear (of Allah) has made them thin like arrows. If any one looks at them, \nhe believes they are sick, although they are not sick at all, and he would \nsay that they have lost their sanity. In fact, a great concern (i.e. fear) has \nmade them look like that. \n \nThey are not satisfied with [what they consider as] their minor \ngood deeds and do not regard their major deeds as great. They always \nblame themselves and are afraid of their deeds. When anyone of them is \nspoken of highly, he says the following: “I know myself better than others \nand my Master knows me better than I know. O Allah! Do not deal with \nme according to what they say, make me better than they think of me and \nforgive me (my shortcomings) which they do not know.” \n \nThe peculiarity of any of them is that you would see that he has \nstrength in religion, determination along with leniency, faith with \nconviction, eagerness in (seeking) knowledge in forbearance, moderation \nwhen rich, devotion in worship, gracefulness in hunger, endurance in \nhardship, desire for what is lawful, pleasure with guidance and hatred for \ngreed. He performs virtuous deeds but still feels alert. In the evening, he \nis anxious to offer thanks (to Allah). In the morning his anxiety is to \nremember (Allah). He fearfully passes his night in adoration and rises in \nthe morning in joy - fear lest night is passed in forgetfulness, and joy over \nthe favor and mercy which he is sure to receive. If his soul refuses to \nendure a thing which it does not like, he does not grant its request towards \nwhat it does like. The coolness of his eye lies in what is to last forever, \nwhile from the things (of this world) that would not last he keeps aloof. \nHe transfuses knowledge with forbearance and speech with action. \nYou would see his hopes simple, his shortcomings few, his heart \nfearing, his spirit contented, his meal small and simple, his religion safe, \nhis desires dead and his anger suppressed. Only goodness is expected \nfrom him. Evil from him is not to be feared. Even if he is found among \nthose who forget (Allah), he is counted among those who remember \n(Him). But if he is among those who remember, he is never counted \namong the forgetful. He forgives whoever is unjust to him, and he gives \nwhoever deprives him. He behaves well with whoever behaves ill towards \nhim. \n \nIndecent speech is far from him; his utterance is lenient, his evils \nare non-existent, his virtues are ever present, his goodness precedes him, \nand mischief turns away from him. He is dignified during calamities, \npatient in distresses and thankful in ease. He does not commit excesses \nagainst anyone whom he may hate and does not commit sin for the sake \nof one who loves him. He admits the truth before testimony is brought \nagainst him. He does not misappropriate what is placed in his custody and \ndoes not forget what he is required to remember. He does not call others \nbad names, he does not cause harm to his neighbor, he does not feel \nhappy at others’ misfortunes, he does not enter into wrong and does not \ngo out of right. \n \nIf he is silent, his silence does not grieve him. If he laughs, he \ndoes not raise his voice and if he is wronged he endures till Allah takes \nrevenge on his behalf. His own “nafs” is in distress because of his own \ndemeanor, while the people are in ease from him. He exposes himself to \nhardship for the sake of his Hereafter while letting people feel safe from \nhim. His keeping away from others is asceticism and purification, while \nhis nearness to those to whom he feels close is out of his own kindness \nand gentleness. His keeping away from others is not out of vanity or \narrogance, nor is his nearness to them is flattery or for deception. \n \nIt is related that Hamman passed into a deep swoon then expired. \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: “Verily, by Allah, I had \nthis fear about him.” Then he added: “Effective advice produces such \neffects on receptive minds.” Someone189 said to him, “O Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib! How is it you do not receive such an effect?” Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) replied: “Woe unto you! For death there is a fixed hour \n \n189This man was Abdullah ibn al-Akwa’ who was in the fore-front of \nthe Kharijite movement and was a great opponent of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x).\nwhich cannot be exceeded and a cause which does not change. Now look, \nnever repeat such talk which Satan had put on your tongue.”"

    "text": "Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Attachment to the Holy Prophet \n(h), Performance of Funeral Rites for Him (h)\nThose companions of Muhammad (k), the custodians (of the \nDivine messages), know that I never disobeyed Allah or His Messenger1 \nat all and by virtue of the courage with which Allah honored me, I \nsupported him with my life on occasions when even the brave turned \naway and feet lagged behind. \n \nWhen the Prophet (h) died, his head was on my chest and his \n(last) breath blew over my palms, and I passed it over my face. I \nperformed his funeral ghusul (ceremonial bath), may Allah bless him and \nhis descendants, and the angels helped me. The house and the courtyard \nwere full of them. One party of them was descending while another was \nascending. My ears continually caught their humming voice, as they \ninvoked Allah’s blessing on him, till we buried him in his grave. Thus, \nwho can have greater rights with him than I during his life or after his \ndeath? Therefore, depend on your enemy because I swear by the One \nWho is such that there is no god but He, that I am on the path of truth and \nthat they (the enemy) are on the misleading path of wrongdoing. You hear \nwhat I say and I seek Allah’s forgiveness for myself and for you. \n \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 10, \npp. 180-183) that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying that he never \ndisobeyed the commands of the Prophet (h) is a sort of taunt to those \nwho felt no hesitation in rejecting the Prophet’s commands and \nsometimes even checked him. For example, when, at the time of the peace \nof al-Hudaybiya, the Prophet (h) was inclined to negotiate peace with \nthe unbelievers from among the tribesmen of Quraish, one of the \ncompanions became so enraged that he expressed doubts about the \nProphethood of the Prophet (h) whereupon Abu Bakr had to say: “Woe \nbe to you! Keep clinging to him. He is certainly Allah’s Messenger, and \nHe will not ruin him.” \n \nThe introduction to the oath, “inna” and the word of emphasis \n“lam”, which are used here [in the original Arabic text] to create \nconviction about the Prophethood shows that the addressee had gone \nfurther than mere doubt because these words of emphasis are employed \nonly when the stage of denial has been reached. However, if belief \nrequired absence of doubt, the presence of doubt must imply defect in the \nbelief, as Allah says the following: “The believers are only those who \nbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, they do not doubt thereafter” (Holy \nQuran, 49: 15). \nSimilarly, when the Prophet (h) intended to perform the funeral \nprayers for Ubayy ibn Salul, the same companion said to him, “How do \nyou intend to seek forgiveness for this chief of hypocrites?” And he even \ndrew away the Prophet (h) by pulling the ends of his shirt... Then the \nProphet (h) had to say, “No deed nothing besides the command of \nAllah.” In the same way, the Prophet’s command to accompany the troops \nled by Usamah ibn Zayd was ignored. The greatest of all such insolence \nwas displayed with regard to the Prophet’s intention to write down his \nadvice to the nation. When such a blame was laid against the Prophet \n(h), a behavior which proves an absence of belief in the commands of \nthe Shari’a and creates doubt about whether each command was based on \nthe Divine revelation or whether (Allah forbid) it was just the result of \n“mental disorder”. \n \nWho can deny that the ever-successful lion of Allah, Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x), shielded the Prophet (h) on every critical occasion \nand performed the duty of protecting him by dint of the courage and valor \ngifted to him by Allah? The first occasion of risking his life was when the \nunbelievers from the tribe of Quraish decided finally to kill the Prophet \n(h). Ali slept on the Prophet’s bed surrounded by enemies and under the \ndirect peril of swords, whereby the enemies were not able to succeed in \ntheir plot. Then, in those battles where the enemies used to attack the \nProphet (h) and where the feet of even the reputed heroes could not \nstand firm, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) remained steadfast with the \nbanner (of Islam) in his hand. Abdul-Barr and al-Hakim writes the \nfollowing about it: “Ibn Abbas says that Ali had four qualities which no \none else possessed. First, he was the first among the Arabs and the non-\nArabs to have offered prayers with the Messenger of Allah. Second, he \nalways had the banner of Islam in his hand in every battle. Third, when \npeople ran away from the Prophet (h), Ali remained with him, and \nFourth, he was the one who gave the Prophet (h) his funeral ablution and \nplaced him in his grave” (Al_Isti’ab, Vol. 3, p. 1090; Al-Mustadrak Ala \nSahihayn, Vol. 3, p. 111). \n \nA study of the holy wars of Islam fought during the Prophet’s \ntime leaves no doubt that, except for the battle of Tabuk in which Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) did not participate, all other battles testify to his \ngreat performance and all the successes are due to his valour. Thus, in the \nbattle of Badr, seventy unbelievers were killed, half of whom were killed \nby Ali’s sword. In the battle of Uhud, when victory changed into defeat as \na result of the Muslims engaging themselves in the collection of booty, \nthey fled away under the sudden attack of the enemy, but Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) remained steadfast, taking jihad to be a religious obligation \nand displayed such conspicuous courage in support and in defense of the \nProphet (h) that the Prophet (h) himself acknowledged it as did arch-\nangel Gabriel. Again, in the battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), the \nProphet (h) was accompanied by three thousand combatants, but none \ndared to face `Amr ibn Abd-Wudd. At last, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nkilled him and saved the Muslims from ignominy. In the battle of Hunain, \nthe Muslims were proud of their number because they were ten thousand \nwhile the unbelievers were only four thousand, but here, too, they leapt \nonto the booty, as a consequence of which the unbelievers gained the \nopportunity and pounced upon them. Taken by surprise thus, the Muslims \nfled away as the Holy Quran says the following verse: “Most certainly did \nAllah help you in many (battle) fields and on the day of Hunain when \nmade your great number was to your liking, but your being superior in \nnumber availed you nothing, and the earth was straitened against you \ndespite its expanse, then you turned back in retreat” (9: 25). \n \nOn this occasion, too, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) remained \nsteadfast like a rock and eventually, with Allah’s support, victory was \nachieved."

I testify that Muhammad (h) is \nthe choice of Allah, the conveyor of His revelation and the Messenger of \nHis mercy. \nWhy Fearing Allah\nI admonish you to fear Allah Who created you. To Him is your \nreturn, with Him lies the success of your aims, at Him terminate (all) your \ndesires, toward Him runs your path of righteousness and He is the aim of \nyour fears (for seeking protection). Certainly, fear of Allah is themedicine \nfor your hearts, the sight for the blindness of your spirits, the cure for the \nailments of your bodies, the rectifier of the evils of your breasts, the \npurifier of the pollution of your minds, the light of the darkness of your \neyes, the consolation for the fear of your heart and the brightness for the \ngloom of your ignorance. \n \nTherefore, make obedience to Allah the way of your life, not only \nyour outside covering. Make it your inner habit instead of only outer \nroutine, subtle enough to enter through your ribs (up to the heart), the \nguide for all your affairs, the watering place for your getting down (on the \nDay of Judgement), the one who intercedes for the achievement of your \naims, the asylum for the day of your fear, the lamp of the interior of your \ngraves, the company for your long loneliness and the deliverance from the \ntroubles of your abodes. Certainly, obedience to Allah is a protection \nagainst encircling calamities, expected dangers and the flames of burning \nfires.\n \nTherefore, whoever entertains fear of Allah, troubles remain away \nfrom him after having been near, affairs become sweet after their \nbitterness, waves (of troubles) recede from him after having crowded over \nhim, difficulties become easy for him after occurring, generosity rains fast \nover him after shortage, mercy bends over him after it had been loath, the \nfavors (of Allah) spring forth on him after they had been dried and \nblessing descends over him in showers after being scanty. So, fear Allah \nWho benefits you with His good advice, preaches to you through His \nMessenger and obliges you with His favors. Devote yourselves to His \nworship and acquit yourselves of the obligation of obeying Him. \nAbout Islam \nIslam is the religion which Allah has chosen for Himself, \ndeveloped it before His eyes, preferred it as the best among His creations, \nestablished its pillars on His love. He has disgraced other religions by \ngiving honor to it. He has humiliated all communities before its sublimity; \nHe has humbled its enemies with His kindness and made its opponents \nlonely by according it His support. He has smashed the pillars of \nmisguidance with its columns. He has quenched the thirst of the thirsty \nwith its cisterns and filled the cisterns through those who draw its water. \n \nHe made Islam such that its constituent parts cannot break, its \njoins cannot separate, its structure cannot fall, its columns cannot decay, \nits plant cannot be uprooted, its time does not end, its laws do not expire, \nits twigs cannot be cut, its parts do not become narrow, its ease does not \nchange into difficulty, its clarity is not affected by gloom, its straightness \ndoes not acquire curvature, its wood has no crookedness, its vast paths \nhave no narrowness, its lamp knows no putting off and its sweetness has \nno bitterness. \n \nIt consists of columns whose bases Allah has fixed in truthfulness \nand whose foundation He has strengthened, and of sources the streams of \nwhich are ever full of water, of lamps the flames of which are full of light \nand of beacons with the help of which travelers get guidance and of signs \nthrough which a way is found to its highways and of watering places \nwhich provide water to those who come to them. Allah has placed in \nIslam the height of His pleasure, the pinnacle of His pillars and the \nprominence of His obedience. Before Allah, therefore, its columns stand \nstrong, its structure is lofty, its proofs are bright, its fires are aflame, its \nauthority is strong, its beacons are high and its destruction is difficult. \nYou should, therefore, honor it, follow it, fulfil its obligations and accord \nthe status due to it. \nAbout the Holy Prophet (h)\nAllah, the Glorified One, deputed Muhammad (k) with the truth \nat a time when the destruction of the world was near and the next life was \nat hand, when its brightness was turning into gloom after shining. It has \nbecome troublesome for its inhabitants, its surface had become rough and \nits decay had approached near. This was during the exhaustion of its life \nat the approach of signs (of its decay), the ruin of its inhabitants, the \nbreaking of its links, the dispersal of its affairs, the decay of its signs, the \ndivulging of its secret matters and the shortening of its length. Allah made \nhim responsible for conveying His message and (a means of) honor for \nhis people, a period of bloom for the men of his days, a source of dignity \nfor the supporters and an honor for his helpers. \nAbout the Holy Quran \nThen Allah sent him the Book as a light whose flames cannot be \nextinguished, a lamp whose gleam does not die, a sea whose depth cannot \nbe sounded, a way whose direction does not mislead, a ray whose light \ndoes not darken, a separator (of good from evil) whose arguments do not \nweaken, one who clarifies, one whose foundations cannot be dismantled, \na cure which leaves no room for disease, an honor whose supporters are \nnot defeated and the truth whose helpers are not abandoned. Therefore, it \nis the mine of belief and its nucleus, the source of knowledge and its \noceans, the plantation of justice and its pools, the foundation stone of \nIslam and its construction, the valleys of truth and its plains, an ocean \nwhich those who draw water cannot empty, springs which those who \ndraw water cannot dry up, a watering place which those who come to take \nwater cannot exhaust, a staging place in moving towards which travelers \ndo not get lost, signs which no trader fails to see and a highland which \nthose who approach it cannot surpass. \n \nAllah has made it quench the thirst of the learned, a bloom for the \nhearts of religious jurists, a highway for the ways of the righteous, a cure \nafter which there is no ailment, a glory with which there is no darkness, a \nrope whose grip is strong, a stronghold whose peak is invulnerable and \nhonor for whoever owes it, a peace for whoever enters it, a guidance for \nwhoever follows it, an excuse for whoever adopts it, an argument for \nwhoever argues with it, a witness for whoever quarrels with it, a success \nfor whoever argues with it, a carrier of burden for whoever seeks the way, \na shield for whoever arms himself (against misguidance), a knowledge for \nwhoever listens carefully, a worthy story for whoever relates it and a final \nverdict of whoever passes judgements."

Certainly, prayer \ndrops out sins like the leaves of trees drop and removes them as ropes are \nremoved from the necks of cattle. The Messenger of Allah (h) likened it \nto a flowing river at the doorstep of a person who takes a bath in it five \ntimes a day. Will then any dirt remain on him? \n \nIts obligation is recognized by those believers whom neither the \nadornment of property nor the coolness of the eyes produced by children \ncan turn away from it. Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: “... \nmen whom neither merchandise nor any diversion distracts them from the \nremembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying the zakat \n(Qur;an, 24: 37). \nEven after receiving assurance of Paradise, the Messenger of \nAllah (k) used to exert himself for the prayers because of the command \nof Allah, the Glorified One. “... enjoin prayer on your followers and \nadhere thereto steadfastly” (Holy Quran, 20: 132). \n \nThen the Holy Prophet (h) used to enjoin his followers to pray \nand exert himself for its sake. \nAbout the Islamic Tax of Zakat \nThen Islamic tax has been laid down along with prayers as a \nsacrifice (to be offered) by the followers of Islam. Whoever pays it by \nway of purifying his spirit, it serves as a purifier for him, a protection and \na shield against the fire (of Hell). No one, therefore, (who pays it) should \nfeel attached to it afterwards, nor should he feel grieved. Whoever pays it \nwithout the intention of purifying his heart, expecting through it to gain \nmore [material rewards], he is certainly ignorant of the Sunnah; he is \nallowed no reward for it; his action goes to waste, and his hope for \nrepentance is excessive! \nFulfillment of Trust\nAs regarding the fulfillment of trust, whoever does not pay \nattention to it will be disappointed. It was placed before the mighty skies, \nthe vast earth and the high mountains, but none was found to be stronger, \nmore vast, or higher than it. If anything could be unapproachable because \nof height, vastness, power or strength, they will have been \nunapproachable. But they felt afraid of the evil consequences (of failing in \nfulfilling a trust) and noticed what a weaker person did not realize it, and \nthis was man. “Verily, he [man] was (proven) unjust, ignorant” (Holy \nQuran, 33: 72). \n \nSurely, Allah, the Glorified One, the Sublime, nothing is hidden \nfrom Him of whatever people do in their nights or days. His knowledge \nencompasses all things. Your limbs are a witness [against you], the organs \nof your body constitute an army (against yourself), your inner self serves \nHim as eyes (to watch over your sins) and your loneliness is open to Him."

    "text": "Treason and Treachery of Mu`awiyah and the Fate of Those \nGuilty of Treason \nBy Allah, Mu`awiyah is not more shrewd than I am, but he \ndeceives and commits evil deeds. Had I not been hateful of deceitfulness, \nI will have been the most cunning of all men. But (the fact is that) deceit \nis a sin and sin is disobedience (of Allah). Every deceitful person will \nhave a banner by which he will be recognized on the Day of Judgement. \nBy Allah, I cannot be made forgetful by strategy, nor can I be \noverpowered by hardships. \n \nPeople who are ignorant of religion and its ethics, free from the \nshackles of religious laws and unaware of the concept of punishment and \nreward find abundance of excuses, methods and means for the \nachievement of their objectives. They can find ways to succeed at every \nstage. But when they find the dictates of humanity, or Islam, or the \nlimitations imposed by ethics and religious laws as impeding their \ndesigns, their chances of devising and finding vile means become narrow \nand the possibility of their action becomes limited. Mu`awiyah’s \ninfluence and control was the result of these devices and ways in which \nhe knew no impediment nor any obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, \nnor did the fear of the Day of Judgement prevent him from acting \ndefiantly. Describing the character of Mu`awiyah, allama ar-Raghib al-\nIsfahani writes the following: “His aim was always to achieve his \nobjective whether lawful or unlawful. He did not care for religion, nor did \nhe ever think of the Divine chastisement. Thus, in order to maintain his \npower, he resorted to false statements and concoctions, practiced all sorts \nof deceit and contrivance. When he saw that success was not possible \nwithout entangling Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in war, he roused Talhah \nand az-Zubayr against him. When success could not be achieved by this \nmeans, he instigated the Syrians, bringing about the civil war of Siffin. \nAnd when the status of his rebellion became exposed through the killing \nof Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying that Ali was responsible \nfor killing him as he had brought him into the battlefield. And on another \noccasion, he interpreted the words ‘rebellious party’ in the hadith of the \nProphet (h) to mean ‘avenging party’, trying desperately to prove that \nAmmar would be killed by the group that would seek revenge of \nOthman’s blood, although the next portion of this statement, that is, ‘he \nwill call them towards Paradise while they will call him to Hell’, does not \nleave any room for interpretation. When there was no hope of victory \neven by these cunning means, he contrived to raise the Holy Quran on the \nspears, although in his view neither the Holy Quran nor its \ncommandments carried any weight. If he had really aimed at deriving a \ndecision from the Holy Quran, he should have put this demand before the \ncommencement of the battle. When it became known to him that the \ndecision had been secured by `Amr ibn al-As by deceiving Abu Musa al-\nAsh`ari and that it did not have even a remote connection with the Holy \nQuran, he should not have accepted it and should have punished `Amr ibn \nal-As for this cunning or at least warned and rebuked him. But on the \ncontrary, the latter’s performance was much appreciated and, in reward, \nhe was made the Governor of Egypt. \n \nIn contrast to this outrage, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s conduct was \na high specimen of religious law and ethics. He kept in view the \nrequirements of truth and righteousness even in adverse circumstances \nand did not allow his virtuous life to be tarnished by the views of deceit \nand contrivance. If he wished, he could face cunning by cunning and \nMu`awiyah’s shameful activities could have been answered by similar \nmeasures. For example, when he posted guards on the Euphrates and \nstopped the supply of its water (to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s men), then \nthe supply of water could have been cut off from them also on the \ngrounds that since they had occupied the Euphrates, it was lawful to \nretaliate. In this way, they could be overpowered by weakening their \nfighting power. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) could never tarnish his \nhands with such an inhuman deed which was not permitted by any law or \ncode of ethics, although common people regard such deeds against the \nenemy as lawful and call this duplicity of character for the achievement of \nsuccess as a normal policy and administrative ability. But Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) could never think of strengthening his power by fraud or \nduplicity of behavior on any occasion. Thus, when people advised him to \nretain the officers who had been appointed during the government of \nOthman and to befriend Talhah and az-Zubayr by assigning them \ngovernorship of KÅfa and Basra and make use of Mu`awiyah’s ability in \nadministration by giving him the government of Syria..., Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) rejected this advice and preferred the commandments of the \nreligious law over worldly expediency and openly declared about \nMu`awiyah as follow: “If I allow Mu`awiyah to retain what he already \nhas, I will be one who takes those who lead (people) astray as helpers” \n(refer to Holy Quran, 18: 51).. \n \nThose who look at apparent successes do not care to find out by \nwhat means the success has been achieved. They support anyone whom \nthey see as succeeding by means of cunning and deception, and they \nbegin to regard him an administrator, a man of intelligence, a politician, \nan intellectually brilliant man..., and so on, while whoever does not \ndeploy cunning and fraudulent methods due to his adherence to Islamic \ncommandments and the Divine instructions and prefers failure over \nsuccess secured through wrong methods is regarded as ignorant of politics \nand weak in foresight. They do not feel it necessary to think what \ndifficulties and impediments exist in the way of a person who adheres to \nprinciples and laws which prevent him from proceeding forward even \nafter approaching near success."

Allah deputed for their guidance \nand directions Prophet Salih who preached to them as Allah relates in his story: \n“And to (the people of) Thamud (We did send) their brother Salih. He said, ‘O \nmy people! Worship Allah (alone); you have no god other than Him. Indeed \nthere came to you a clear proof from your Master: this is the she-camel of Allah \n(which) to you is a Sign; so, leave it to pasture in Allah’s earth and do not touch \nher with any harm or else you should be seized with a painful chastisement.

O \nProphet of Allah (k), my patience about your chosen (daughter) has been \nexhausted and my power of endurance has weakened, except that I have \nground for consolation in having endured the great hardship and heart-\nrending event of your separation.

Bring us that with which you did threaten us, if you are [as you \nclaim] one of the Messengers.’ Then the earthquake seized them (while they \nwere unaware), so they became in their dwellings motionless. Then he turned \naway from them and said: ‘O my people! Indeed I did deliver to you the \nmessage of my Lord and did admonish you, but you do not love those who \nadmonish you’” (Holy Quran, 7: 73-79). (The people of) Thamud belied the \nwarners and said: “What?! A single man from among us [thus dares to warn us]! \nAnd we are to follow him?! Verily, then, we shall be straying and in distress. It \nis that reminding has been bestowed on him (alone) of all people from among \nus?! Nay!

And (you O Salih!) make them aware (beforehand) that the water is (to \nbe) divided between them, and every drinking share shall be witnessed. But they \ncalled their companions, then he pursued and hamstrung her. How (great) was \nMy chastisement and My warning? Verily We sent upon them a single (violent) \nblast and they were (all) like the dry stubble used by a fencer in a fence” (Holy \nQuran, 54: 23-31). \n“Verily we are Allah’s and verily to Him shall we return” (Holy \nQuran, 2: 156). \n \nNow, the trust has been returned, and what had been given has \nbeen taken back.

Although Sayyidatul-Nisa’[head of all \nwomen of mankind], Fatima (x), did not live in this world more than a few \nmonths after the death of her most revered father, the Prophet (h), yet even this \nshort period has a long tale of grief to tell and many woes. In this regard, the \nfirst scene that strikes the eyes is the fact that the arrangements for the funeral \nrites of the Prophet (h) had not yet been made when the contest for power and \nauthority started at the saqifa [shed] of Banu Sa’idah. Naturally, their leaving \nthe body of the Prophet (h) (without burial) must have deeply injured the grief-\nstricken heart of Sayyidatul Nisa’, Fatima (x). She saw how those who had \nprofessed love and attachment to the Prophet (h)) during his life-life became so \nengrossed in their machinations for pursuing power and authority, so much so \nthat instead of consoling his only daughter, they did not even care to know when \nthe Prophet (h) was to be given his funeral rites and when he was to be buried. \nAnd the way they “consoled” her was by crowding at her house after having \nbrought firewood in order to set fire to her house and to burn everyone inside it. \nAll of this they did in order to secure the oath of allegiance by such brute force \nfrom her husband, Imam Ali (x), and from Ahl al-Bayt (x). They justified all of \nthis coercion, compulsion and violence to achieve their goal of usurping the \npower of the government for themselves. In fact, all these excesses were to \nobliterate the prestigious status of this house. They thus hoped it might not \nregain its lost prestige on any occasion in the future. With this aim in view, and \nin order to crush her economic status and that of her family, by confiscating her \n(estate of) Fadak through trickery and falsehood..., the ultimate effect was that \nSayyidatul-Nisa’ Fatima (x) was killed with grief in her heart, and even then, \nnone was there to witness her burial. Till now, nobody even knows where she \nwas buried... Love for this world thus blinds people. \nstay, it is not due to lack of belief in what Allah has promised those who \nendure."

When He Noticed \nthe Vastness of His Mansion Estate, He Said the Following : \nWhat will you do with this vast house in this world, although you \nneed this house more in the next world? If you want to take it to the next \nworld, you can entertain in it guests and be regardful of kinship and \ndischarge all (your) obligations according to their accrual. In this way, \nyou will be able to take it to the next world. \n \nThen al-Ala said to him: “O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)! I want \nto complain to you about my brother Asim ibn Ziyad.” Imam Ali ibn Abu \n \nagree to arbitration. Among these people there were some who had actually been \nduped, believing that they were being asked to abide by the Holy Quran, but \nthere were others who had become weary of the long duration of the war and \nhad lost stomach for it, thus cowering. Then people got a good opportunity to \nstop the war; so, they cried hoarse for its postponements. There were others who \nhad accompanied Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) because of his temporal authority \nbut did not support him by heart, nor did they aim at achieving victory for him. \nThere were some people who had expectations with Mu`awiyah and had started \nattaching hopes to him for worldly gains, while there were some who were, from \nthe very beginning, [covertly] in league with him. In these circumstances, and \nwith such an army, it was really due to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s political \nability and competence of military control and administration that he carried out \nthe war up to this stage. Had Mu`awiyah not adopted this trick, there could have \nbeen no doubt in Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s victory because the military power \nof the Syrian forces had been exhausted and defeat was hovering over their \nheads. In this regard, Ibn Abul-Hadd writes the following: “Malik al-Ashtar had \nreached Mu`awiyah and [angrily] grabbed him by the neck. The entire might of \nthe Syrians had been smashed. Only so much movement was discernable in \nthem as remains in the tail of a lizard which is killed, but the tail continues \nhopping right and left” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 11, pp.30-1). \nTalib (x) inquired: “What is the matter with him?” Al-Ala’ said the \nfollowing: “He has put on a woolen coat and cut off himself from the \nworld.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “Let me see him.” When the \nman came, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said to him, “O enemy of \nyourself! Certainly, the evil one (Satan) has misguided you. Do you feel \nno compassion for your wife and children? Do you believe that if you use \nthose things which Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? \nYou are too unimportant for Allah to do so.” The man said, “O Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x)! You yourself put on coarse outfits and eat rough food.” \nThe Imam replied thus: “Woe unto you! I am not like you. Certainly, \nAllah, the Sublime, has made it obligatory on true leaders that they should \nmaintain themselves at the level of low people so that the poor do not cry \nover their poverty.”\n \nSince ancient times, asceticism and the abandonment of worldly \nattachments has been regarded as a means of purification of the spirit and \nimportance of the soul. Consequently, those who wished to lead a life of \nabstention and meditation used to go out of the cities and towns to stay in \nforests and caves in the mountains and stay there concentrating on Allah \naccording to their own way of thinking. They would eat only if a casual \ntraveler or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings gave them anything to eat; \notherwise, they remained contented with the fruits of wild trees and the \nwater of the streams. Thus did they pass their life away from the public. \nActually, this way of “worship” commenced in a way that was forced by \nthe oppression and cruelty of rulers. Certain people left their houses and, \nin order to avoid the grip of such rulers, hid in some wilderness or a cave \nin a mountain, engaging themselves in worship of and devotion to Allah. \nLater on, this forced asceticism acquired a voluntary form and people \nbegan to retire to caves and hollows of their own volition. Thus, it became \nan accepted way that whoever aimed at spiritual development retired to \nsome corner after severing himself from all worldly ties. This method \nremained in vogue for centuries. Even nowadays, some traces of this way \nof “worship” are found among Buddhists and Christians. \n \nThe moderate views of Islam do not, however, agree with the \nmonastic life style. In order to attain spiritual development, one does not \nhave to abandon lawful worldly enjoyments and pleasures, nor should a \nMuslim leave his house and fellow men and keep himself occupied in \nsuch sort of “worship.” One must not thus hide in some corner. The \nconcept of worship in Islam is not confined to a few particular rituals. \nIslam regards the earning of one’s livelihood through lawful means, \nsympathy with and concern about others, good behavior, and cooperation \nwith and assistance of others are absolutely important, so important that \nthey are the stuff of true worship. If an individual ignores his \nresponsibilities and does not fulfil his obligations towards his wife and \nchildren, nor does he occupy himself with earning a livelihood but instead \nspends all his time meditating, he ruins his life and does not fulfil the \npurpose of living in this world. If this were Allah’s aim behind creating \nHis servants, what would have been the need for creating and populating \nthe world especially when there was already a category of beings who all \nthe time are engaged in worshipping and adoring the Lord of Lords, \nseeking forgiveness for His servants? \n \nThe Creator has made man stand at the cross-roads of options \nwhere the mid-way represents the center of guidance. If he deviates from \nthis point of moderation even a bit, tilting towards this way or that, there \nis nothing but sheer misguidance for him. That mid-way is that he should \nneither bend towards this world to such an extent that he ignores the next \nlife, devoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from this \nworld to the extent that he has no regard for nor interest in anything in it, \nconfining himself to some corner, isolating himself from everyone. Since \nAllah has created man and placed him in this world, man should follow \nthe code of life for living in this world. He should partake of the comforts \nand pleasures bestowed by Allah within moderate limits. Eating and \nenjoying things made lawful by Allah does not go against Allah’s \nworship. Rather, Allah has created these things for the very purpose that \nthey should be enjoyed, and so that He would be thanked for providing \nthem for mankind. That is why those who were chosen and preferred by \nAllah from among all His servants lived in this world with others eating, \ndrinking, marrying and fathering children just like all others. They did not \nfeel the need to turn their faces away from the people of this world and \nadopt a norm of life in the wilderness, in caves of mountains as their \nabodes, or in places distant from the public. On the other hand, they \nremembered Allah, remained disentangled from worldly affairs and did \nnot forget death despite the pleasures and comforts of this life. \n \nThe life of asceticism sometimes produces such evils that ruin the \nnext life for the “ascetic” person also as well as ruining this one. Such an \nindividual proves to be the true portrait of one who loses this life as well \nas the next. When natural urges are not satisfied in the lawful and legal \nway, the mind turns into a center of evil-insinuated ideas, becoming \nincapable of performing worship with peace and concentration. And \nsometimes passions overcome the ascetic to the extent that he would \nbreak all moral fetters, devoting himself completely to their satisfaction. \nConsequently, man falls into an abyss of ruin from which it is impossible \nto extract himself. That is why religious laws accord a greater status to the \nworship performed by a family man than that by a non-family man \nbecause the former can exercise mental peace and concentration in the \nworship and rituals. \n \nIndividuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make a loud show \nof their spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of Islam and are \nignorant of its wide teachings. They have been misled by Satan and, \nrelying on their self-formed concepts, tread wrongful paths. Eventually, \ntheir misguidance becomes so serious that they begin to regard their \nleaders as having attained such a level that their word is like the word of \nAllah, and their deed is as though that of Allah... Sometimes, they regard \nthemselves as being beyond all the bounds and limitations of religious \nlaws, considering every evil deed as lawful for them. This deviation from \nthe faith and creed is labeled as Sufism. Its unlawful principles are called \ntariqah (way of achieving communion with Allah) and the followers of \nthis cult are known as Sufis. First, Abu Hashim al-Kufi al-Shami adopted \nthis title. He was of an Umayyad descent and a fatalist (believing that man \nis bound to act as pre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him this \nname was that in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear of \nAllah, he put on a woolen cloak. Later on, this title became common and \nvarious grounds were put forth as the bases of this name. For example, \none ground is that sufi has three letters: the sad, waw and fa’. Sad stands \nfor sabr, endurance, sidq, truthfulness, and safa, purity of heart. The waw, \naccording to them, stands for wudd, love or affection, wird (repetition of \nAllah’s Name) and wafa’, faithfulness to Allah. The fa’ stands for fard, \nunity or oneness, faqr, poverty or destitution, and fana’, death or \nabsorption in the Self of Allah. The second view is that it has been \nderived from “as-Suffah”, a platform near the Prophet’s mosque which \nhad a covering of date-palm leaves and which housed a number of poor \nand homeless companions of the Prophet (k). Those who stayed there \nwere called ashabus-Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is \nthat the name of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah and his tribe \nperformed the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka`ba, and it is with \nreference to their regard that this tribe and those people were called Sufis. \nThis group is divided among various sects but the basic sects are seven \nonly as follows: \n \n1) al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian): This sect believes in the oneness \nof all existence. Its belief is that everything IN this world is Allah, so \nmuch so that they assign to even polluted things the same divine status. \nThey liken Allah with the river and the waves rising in it, arguing that the \nwaves which sometimes rise and sometimes fall have no separate \nexistence other than the river, but their existence is exactly the existence \nof the river. Therefore, nothing can be separated from its own existence. \n \n2) al-Ittihayyah (the unitists): They believe that they have united \nwith Allah and Allah has united with them. They liken Allah with fire and \nthemselves with iron that lies in the fire from which it acquires its form \nand quality. \n \n3) al-Huluyyah (the formists): Their belief is that Allah takes the \nform of those who claim to know Him and the perfect ones and their \nbodies are places of His stay. In this way, they are seemingly men but \nreally Allah. \n \n4) al-Wasiliyyah (the combiners): This sect considers itself to \nhave combined with Allah. Their belief is that the laws of the Shar’a are \na means of development of the human personality and character and that \nwhen the human self combines with Allah, it no longer needs perfection \nor development. Consequently, for the Wasilis, worship and ritual become \nuseless because they hold that when truth/reality is achieved, the Shari`a \nbecomes irrelevant. Therefore, they can do anything, and they cannot be \nquestioned.\n \n5) az-Zarraqiyyah (the revelers): This sect regards vocal and \ninstrumental music as worship; it earns the pleasures of this world \nthrough a show of asceticism and from door to door begging. They are \never engaged in relating concocted stories of miraculous performances of \ntheir leaders in order to impress the common people. \n \n6) al-Ushshaqiyyah (the lovers): The theory of this sect is: \nApparency is the means to reality, meaning that carnal love is the means \nto achieve the love of Allah. That is, in order to reach the stage of Allah’s \nlove, it is necessary to have love with a human beauty. But the love which \nthey regard as love for Allah is just the product of mental disorder \nthrough which the lover inclines to one individual with all his attention. \nHis final objective is to have access to the beloved one. This love can lead \nto the way of evil and vice, but it has no connection with the love of \nAllah.\n \nA Persian couplet says: “The truth of the fact is that carnal desire \nis like a jinn, and a jinn cannot give you guidance.” \n \n7) at-Talqiniyyah (the encounterers): According to this “sect”, the \nreading of religious sciences and books of scholarship is totally unlawful. \nInstead, the status that is achieved by an hour of spiritual effort of the \nSufis cannot be achieved even by seventy years of book reading. \n \nAccording to Shi`a ulema’, all these sects are on the wrong path \nand out of the fold of Islam. In this regard, numerous sayings of the \nImams are related. In this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has \nregarded the severance of Asim ibn Ziyad from this world as the mischief \nof Satan. He strongly dissuaded him from adopting that course. (For \nfurther study, see Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, al-Hajj Mirza Habibullah a-\nKhoei, Vol. 13, pp.132-417; Vol. 14, pp. 2-22)."

    "text": "Someone1 Asked Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) about \nConcocted Traditions and Contradictory Sayings of the Prophet (h)\nWhich Were Then in Circulation among the Public. The Imam Said \nthe Following : \nCertainly, what is current among the people is both right and \nwrong, true and false, repealing and repealed, general and particular, \ndefinite and indefinite, exact and surmised. Even during the Prophet’s \ndays, false sayings had been attributed to him, so much so that he had to \nsay during his sermon that “Whoever attributes falsehoods to me makes \nhis own abode in Hell.” Those who relate traditions are no more than four \ncategories:\n \n194This person was Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali, one of the narrators of traditions \nthrough Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). \n1. The Lying Hypocrites \n \nThe hypocrite is a person who makes a show of faith and adopts \nthe appearance of a Muslim. He does not hesitate to sin, nor does he keep \naloof from vice. He willfully attributes false things to the Messenger of \nAllah. If people knew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not \naccept anything from him and would not consider what he says. Rather, \nthey would say that he is the companion of the Prophet (h), has met him, \nheard (his statements) and acquired knowledge from him. They, therefore, \naccept what he says. Allah, too, had warned you against the hypocrites \nand described them fully to you. They have continued after the Holy \nProphet (h). They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance and \ncallers towards Hell through falsehoods and slandering. So, the latter put \nthem in high positions and made them officers over the heads of the \npeople, letting them amass wealth. People are always with the rulers and \nafter this world except those to whom Allah affords protection. This is the \nfirst of the four categories. \n2. Those Who are Mistaken \nThen there is the individual who heard (a saying) from the Holy \nProphet (h) but did not memorize it as it was, but surmised its gist. He \ndoes not lie willfully. Now, he carries the saying with him and relates it, \ndepends upon it and claims that: “I heard it from the Messenger of Allah.” \nIf the Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they \nwill not accept it from him, and if he himself knows that he is wrong, he \nwill give it up. \n3. Those Who are Ignorant\nThe third man is one who heard the Prophet (h) ordering to do \nsomething, and later the Prophet (h) forbade people from doing it, but \nthis man did not know it, or he heard the Prophet (h) forbidding people \nfrom doing something and later he allowed it, but this man did not know \nit. In this case, he retained in his mind what had been repealed and did not \nretain the repealing tradition. If he knew that it had been repealed, he \nwould reject it, or if the Muslims knew, when they heard it from him, that \nit had been repealed, they would reject it. \n4. Those Who Accurately Memorize \nThe last, namely the fourth man, is whoever does not speak a lie \nagainst Allah or against His Prophet (h). He hates falsehood out of fear \nfor Allah and respect for the Messenger of Allah and does not commit \nmistakes, but retains (in his mind) exactly what he heard (from the \nProphet (h)) and he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or \nomitting anything. He heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and \nacted upon it and he heard the repealed tradition and rejected it. He also \nunderstands the particular and the general and he knows the definite and \nindefinite and gives everything its due status. \n \nThe sayings of the Prophet (h) used to be of two types. One was \nparticular and the other common. Sometimes a man would hear him but \nhe would not know what Allah, the Glorified One, meant by it or what the \nMessenger of Allah meant by it. In this way the listener carries it and \nmemorizes it without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what \nwas its reason. Among the companions of the Messenger of Allah all \nwere not in the habit of putting him questions and ask him the meanings, \nindeed they always wished that some Bedouin or stranger might come and \nask him (x) so that they would also listen. Whenever any such thing came \nbefore me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it. These are the \nreasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions. \n \nIn this sermon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has divided the \ntraditionists into four categories:. \n \nThe first category is that of a man who concocts a tradition then \nattributes it to the Prophet (h). Traditions were in fact falsified and \nattributed to him even during his holy life-time. This process continued \nwith the result that numerous fabricated traditions came into existence. \nThis is a fact which cannot be denied, but if anyone does deny it, his basis \nwould not be knowledge, or sagacity by oratory, or argumentative \nnecessity. Thus, once, “alamul-huda” (the ensign of guidance), namely \nSayyid al-Murtada, had a chance to meet some Sunni ulema’ (scholars) \nwith whom he made a debate. During that incident, Sayyid al-Murtada \nproved by citing historical facts that the traditions related about the merits \nof the “great companions” (or the “righteous caliphs”) were concocted \nand fabricated. On this, the (Sunni) ulema’ argued that it was impossible \nthat someone should dare to speak a lie against the Prophet (h) and make \nup a tradition by himself then attribute it to the Prophet (k). Sayyid al-\nMurthada said that there was a tradition of the Prophet (h) that: \n \n“Many false things will be attributed to me after my death; \nwhoever speaks a lie against me will be preparing his own abode in Hell” \n(al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, p. 38; Vol. 2, p. 102; Vol. 4, p. 207; Vol. 8, p. 54; \nMuslim, Vol. 8, p. 229; Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, pp. 319-320; al-Tirmidhi, \nVol. 4, p. 524; Vol. 5, pp. 35-36, 40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, pp. 13-\n15).\n \nIf you regard this tradition as true, then you should agree that \nfalse things have, indeed, been attributed to the Prophet (h). But if you \nregard it as false, this would still prove our point. However, these were \npeople whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who used to make up \ntraditions of their own in order to create mischief and dispersion in \nreligion and to misguide the Muslims of weak convictions. Such \nfabricators kept thus fabricating “traditions” just as they used to do during \nthe lifetime of the Prophet (h) just as they remained busy in their \nactivities of mischief and destruction in those days. They were not \nunmindful of altering the teachings of Islam and metamorphosing its \nsaline features. Rather, in the days of the Prophet (h), they were always \nafraid lest he should expose them and put them to shame. But after the \ndemise of the Prophet (h), their hypocritical activities increased, and \nthey attributed false things to the Prophet (h) without demur for their \nown personal ends. Those who heard them believed in them because of \ntheir status as companions of the Prophet (h), thinking that whatever \nthey said was correct and whatever they gave out was true. Afterwards, \nthe belief that all the companions are correct put a stopper on their \ntongues, as a result of which they were taken to be above criticism, \nquestioning, discussion and censure. Besides, their conspicuous \nperformance had made them prominent in the eyes of the government. \nAlso because of this, the government lacked the courage to speak against \nthem. This is proven by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words: “These people \ngained positions with the leaders of misguidance and callers towards Hell, \nthrough falsehood and slandering. So, they put them in high positions and \nmade them officers over the heads of the people.” \n \nAlong with the destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at \namassing wealth. They were doing so claiming to be Muslims because of \nwhich they did not want to remove the veil of Islam (from their faces) and \nto come out openly. They wanted to continue their Satanic activities under \nthe garb of Islam, engaging themselves in its basic destruction, spreading \ndivision and dissension by concocting false “traditions”. In this regard, \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written the following: “When they were left free, \nthey, too, left many things. When people remained silent about them, they \nalso remained silent about Islam. But they continued their underground \nactivities such as the fabrication of falsehoods to which Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) has alluded. Many untrue matters had been mixed with the \ntraditions by the same group of people of wrong beliefs who aimed at \nmisguidance and the distortion of views and beliefs, while some of them \nalso aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had other \nworldly aims as well.” \n \nOn the expiration of this period, when Mu`awiyah took over the \nleadership of the religion and occupied the throne of temporal authority, \nhe opened an official department for the fabrication of “traditions”, \nordering his officers to fabricate and popularize traditions in \ndisparagement of Ahl al-Bayt (x) (the Household of the Holy Prophet \n[h]), extol Othman and the Umayyads, and announcing generous \nrewards and land grants for this work. Consequently, a lot of traditions \nabout self-made distinctions gained entry in the books of traditions. Thus, \nAbul-Hassan al-Mada’ini has written in his book Kitab al-ahadith which \nIbn Abul-Hadid has quoted as follows: “Mu`awiyah wrote to his officers \nthat they should take special care of those who were followers of Othman, \nhis well-wishers and lovers and to award high status, precedence and \nhonor to those who related traditions about his merits and distinctions,and \nto convey to him whatever is thus related by any person, along with his \nname, the name of his father and the name of his tribe. They did \naccordingly and heaped up traditions about the merits and distinctions of \nOthman because Mu`awiyah used to award them rewards, clothes, grants \nand lands.” \n \nWhen the fabricated traditions about the merits of Othman had \nbeen disseminated throughout the Islamic lands, with the idea that the \nstatus of the earlier Caliphs should not remain low, Mu`awiyah wrote the \nfollowing to his officers: “As soon as you receive this order of mine, you \nshould call upon the people to make up traditions about the distinctions of \nthe companions and other caliphs, too. Make sure that if any Muslim \nrelates any tradition in praise of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), you should \nmake up a similar tradition about the companions to contradict it because \nthis gives me great pleasure and cools my eyes and it weakens the status \nof Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib and his party and is more severe to them than \nthe merits and distinctions of Othman. When his letters were read to the \npeople, a large number of such traditions were related extolling the \ncompanions that are all fabricated with no truth at all” (Sharh Nahjul-\nBalagha, Vol. 11, pp. 43-47). \n \nIn this regard, “Abu Abdillah”, namely Ibrahm ibn Muhammad \nibn Arafah, famous as Niftawayh (244/858 - 323/935), was one of the \nprominent scholars and traditionists who have written about this subject. \nIbn Abul-Hadid has quoted him saying, “Most false traditions about the \nmerits of the companions were fabricated during the days of Mu`awiyah \nin order to gain status in his audience because his view was that in this \nway he could disgrace Banu Hashim and render their status low” (Ibid.). \n \nAfter that, fabrication of traditions became a good paying job for \nmany. The seekers of this world made it a means of securing status with \ntheir contemporary kings and nobles and to amass wealth. For example, \nGhiyath ibn Ibrahim an-Nakh`i (2nd cent. A.H.) fabricated a tradition \nabout the flight of pigeons in order to please al-Mahdi ibn al-Mansur (the \nAbbasid caliph) and to secure a status near to him (Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. \n12, pp. 323-327; Mizan al-I’tidal, Vol. 3, pp.337-338; Lisan al-Mizan, \nVol. 4, p.422). Abu Sa’id al-Mada’ini and others made it a means of \nlivelihood. The maximum limit was reached when al-Karramiyya and \nsome of the al-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the fabrication of \ntraditions for the prevention of sin or for persuasion towards obedience \nwas lawful. Consequently, with regard to persuading and dissuading, \ntraditions were fabricated quite freely, and this was not regarded as being \nagainst the religious law or in contradiction with morality. Rather, this \nwork was generally done by those who bore the appearance of asceticism \nor fear of Allah and who passed their nights in praying and days in filling \ntheir books with false traditions. An idea about the number of these \nfabricated traditions can be formulated from the fact that out of six \nhundred thousand traditions, al-Bukhari selected only two thousand and \nseven hundred and sixty-one traditions (Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 2, p.8; Al-\nIrshad as-Sari, Vol. 1, p.28; Sifatul-Safwah, Vol. 4, p. 143). Muslim \nregarded for selection in his book only four thousand out of three hundred \nthousand traditions (Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 13, p. 101; Al-Muntzam, Vol. \n5, p.32; Tabaqat al-Huffaz, Vol. 2, pp. 151, 157; Wafiyyat al-A’yan, Vol. \n5, p. 194). Abu Dawud took four thousand and eight hundred out of five \nhundred thousand (Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 9, p. 57; Tabaqat al-Huffaz, Vol. \n2, p. 154; Al-Muntazam, Vol. 5, p. 97; Wafiyyat al-A’yan, Vol. 2, p. 404) \nand Ahmed ibn Hanbal took thirty thousand out of nearly one million \ntraditions (Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 4, p. 419-420; Tabaqat al-Huffaz, Vol. 2, \np. 17; Wafiyyat al-A’yan, Vol. 1, p. 64; Tahthib al-Tahthib, Vol. 1, p. 74). \nBut when this selection is studied, some traditions which come across \ncan, in no circumstances, be attributed to the Prophet (h). The result is \nthat a group of considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, \nin view of these so-called authoritative collections and true traditions, \ncompletely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For further \nreference see al-Ghadr, Vol. 5, pp. 208-378). \n \nThe second category of narrators of traditions are those who, \nwithout appreciating the occasion or context, related whatever they could \nrecollect, right or wrong. Thus, in al-Bukhari (Vol. 2, pp. 100-102; Vol. 5, \np. 98); Muslim (Vol. 3, pp. 41-45); al-Tirmidhi (Vol. 3, pp. 327-329); al-\nNisa’i (Vol. 4, p. 18); Ibn Majah (Vol. 1, pp. 508-509); Malik ibn Anas \n(Al-Muwatta’, Vol. 1, p. 234); ash-Shafi’i (Ikhtilaful-Hadith, on the side \nlines of Al-Umm, Vol. 7, p. 266); Abu Dawud (Vol. 3, p. 194); Ahmed \nibn Hanbal (Vol. 1, pp. 41, 42) and al-Baqyhaqi (Vol. 4, pp. 72-74) in the \nchapter entitled ‘weeping over the dead’ it is stated that when `Umar was \nwounded Suhayb came weeping to him, then Umar said the following: “O \nSuhayb! If you weep mourn me, the Prophet (h) had said that the dead \nperson is punished if his people mourn him.” \n \nAfter the death of Umar, this dialogue was mentioned to Aisha. \nShe said the following: “May Allah have mercy on `Umar! The \nMessenger of Allah did not say that mourning relatives brings about a \npunishment on the dead, but he said that the punishment of an unbeliever \nincreases if people mourn him.” After this, Aisha said that according to \nthe Holy Quran, nobody had to bear the burden of another; so, how could \nthe burden of those who weep be placed on the dead? After this, the \nfollowing verse was quoted by Aisha: “No bearer of a burden shall bear \nthe burden of another” (Holy Quran, 6: 164; 17: 15; 35: 18; 39: 7; 53: 38). \n \nThe wife of the Holy Prophet (h), Aisha, relates that once the \nProphet (h) passed by a Jewish woman on account of whose death her \npeople were weeping. The Prophet (h) then remarked, “Her people are \nweeping over her, but she is undergoing punishment in the grave.” \n \nThe third category of the narrators of traditions is that of those \nwho heard some repealed traditions from the Prophet (h) but could not \nget any change to hear the repealing traditions which he could relate to \nothers. An example of a repealing tradition is the statement of the Prophet \n(h) which also contains a reference to the repealed tradition, namely: “I \nhad prohibited you from visiting graves, but now you can visit them” \n(Muslim, Vol. 3, p. 65; al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 3, p. 370; Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, \npp. 218, 332; al-Nisa’i, Vol. 4, p. 89; Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, pp. 500-501; \nMalik ibn Anas, Vol. 2, p. 485; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, pp. 145,452; \nVol. 3, pp. 38, 63, 66, 237, 350; Vol. 5, pp. 350, 355, 356, 357, 359, 361; \nal-Hakim, Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 1, pp. 374-376, and al-Bayhaqi, Vol. 4, pp. \n76-77). Herein, the permission to visit graves has repealed the previous \nrestriction. Now, those who heard only the repealed tradition continued \nacting according to it. \n \nThe fourth category of narrators of traditions is that of those who \nwere fully aware of the principles of justice, possessed intelligence and \nsagacity, knew the occasion when a tradition was first uttered (by the \nProphet [h]) and were also acquainted with the repealing and the \nrepealed traditions, the particular and the general, and the temporary and \nthe permanent. They avoided falsehood and fabrication. Whatever they \nheard remained preserved in their memory, and they conveyed it with \nexactness to others. It is they whose traditions are the precious wealth of \nIslam, free from fraud and counterfeit, worthy of being trusted and acted \nupon. That collection of traditions, which has been conveyed through \ntrustworthy bosoms like that of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and has \nremained free from cutting, curtailing, alteration, present Islam in its true \nform. The status of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in Islamic knowledge has \nbeen most certainly proved through traditions narrated from the Holy \nProphet (h) such as:. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), Jabir ibn `Abdullah, Ibn `Abbas and \nAbdullah ibn `Umar have narrated from the Holy Prophet (h) that he \nsaid the following: “I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate. \nWhoever wants to acquire (my) knowledge should come through its gate \n(Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, pp. 126-127; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1102; Usd al-\nGhaba, Vol. 4, p. 22; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 2, p. 377; Vol. 4, p. 348; Vol. \n7, p. 172; Vol. 11, pp. 48-50; Tadhkirah al-Huffaz, Vol. 4, p. 28; Majma’ \nal-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, p. 114; Tahthib al-Tahthib, Vol. 6, p. 320; Vol. 7, p. \n337; Lisan al-Mizan, Vol. 2, pp. 122-123; Tarikh al-Khulafa’, p. 170; \nKanz al-Ummal, Vol. 6, pp. 152, 156, 401; `Umdat al-Qari, Vol. 7, p. \n631; Sharh al-Mawahib al-Laduniyya, Vol. 3, p. 143). \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and ibn Abbas have also cited the \nHoly Prophet (h) saying, “I am the store-house of wisdom and Ali is its \ndoor. Whoever wants to acquire wisdom should come through its door” \n(Hilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 1, p. 64; Masabih as-Sunna, Vol. 2, p. 275; \nTarikh Baghdad, Vol. 11, p. 204; Kanz al-Ummal, Vol. 6, p. 401; Al-\nRiyad al-Nadara, Vol. 12, p. 193). \n \nIf only people could take the Prophet’s blessings through these \nsources of knowledge! But it is a tragic chapter of history that although \ntraditions are accepted through the Kharijites and enemies of the \nProphet’s family, whenever the series of relaters includes the name of any \nindividual from among the Prophet’s family, there is hesitation in \naccepting that tradition...!"

    "text": "Delivered at the Battle of Siffin Mutual Rights of the Ruler \nand the Ruled \nBy placing me over your affairs, Allah, the Glorified One, has \ncreated my right over you and you, too, have a right over me like mine \nover you, a right is very vast in description but very narrow in equity. It \ndoes not accrue to any person unless it accrues against him also, and right \ndoes not accrue against a person unless it also accrues in his favor. If \nthere is any right, which is only in favor of a person with no \n(corresponding) right accruing against him, it is solely for Allah, the \nGlorified One, not for His creatures by virtue of His might over His \ncreatures, and by virtue of the justice permeating all His decrees. Of \ncourse, He, the Glorified One, has created His right over creatures to \nworship Him and has laid upon Himself (the obligation of) their reward \nequal to several times the recompense as a mark of His bounty and the \ngenerosity that He is capable of. \n \nThen, from His rights, He, the Glorified One, created certain \nrights for certain people against others. He made them so in order to \nequate one with another. Some of these rights produce other rights. Some \nrights are such that they do not accrue except with others. The greatest of \nthese rights is that Allah, the Glorified One, has made obligatory the right \nof the ruler over the ruled, and the right of the ruled over the ruler. This is \nan obligation which Allah, the Glorified One, has placed on each other. \nHe has made it the basis of their (mutual) affection and an honor for their \nreligion. Consequently, the ruled cannot prosper unless the rulers are \nsound, while the rulers cannot be sound unless the ruled are steadfast. \n \nIf the ruled fulfil the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfills their \nrights, then right attains the status of honor among them, the ways of \nreligion become established, the signs of justice become fixed and the \nSunnah gains currency. \n \nIn this way, time would improve, the continuance of government \nwould be expected and the aims of the enemies would be frustrated. But if \nthe ruled gain sway over the ruler, or if the ruler oppresses the ruled, then \ndifferences crop up in every word, signs of oppression appear, mischief \ncreeps into the creed and the ways of the Sunnah are forsaken. Then \ndesires are acted upon, the commands (of religion) are discarded, diseases \nof the spirit become numerous and there is no hesitation in disregarding \neven great rights, nor in committing big wrongdoings. In such \ncircumstances, the virtuous are humiliated while the vicious are honored, \nand in this there are serious chastisements from Allah, the Glorified One, \non the people. \n \nYou should, therefore, counsel each other (for the fulfillment of \nyour obligations) and cooperate with each other. However extremely \neager a person may be to secure the pleasure of Allah, and however fully \nhe strives for it, he cannot totally discharge (his obligation for) obedience \nto Allah, the Glorified One, as is really due to Him. It is an obligatory \nright of Allah over the people that they should advise each other to the \nbest of their ability and cooperate with each other for the establishment of \nthe truth among them. Nobody, however great his status in the matter of \nthe truth, and however advanced his distinction in religion may be, is \nabove cooperation with regard to the obligations placed on him by Allah. \nAgain, no man, however small he may be regarded by others and however \nhumble he may appear before their eyes, is too low to cooperate or to be \nafforded cooperation in this matter. \n \nOne of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s companions replied to him with \na long speech of his own wherein he praised him much and referred to his \nlistening to him and obeying him, whereas Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nsaid the following:\nIf a man in his mind regards Allah’s glory as being high and \nbelieves in his heart that Allah’s status is sublime, then it is his right that \non account of the greatness of these things, he should regard all other \nthings as minor. Among such persons he on whom Allah’s bounty is great \nand Allah’s favors are kind has a greater obligation because Allah’s \nbounty over any person does not increase without a corresponding \nincrease in Allah’s right over him. \n \nIn the view of virtuous people, the worst status of rulers is that it \nmay be thought about them that they love glory and their affairs may be \ntaken to be based on pride. I would really hate that it may cross your mind \nthat I love high praises or hear eulogies. By the grace of Allah, I am not \nlike this. Even if I had loved to be mentioned like this, I would have given \nit up in submissiveness before Allah, the Glorified One, rather than accept \ngreatness and sublimity to which He is more entitled. Generally, people \nfeel pleased at praise after good performances. But do not mention to me \nhandsome praise for the obligations which I have discharged towards \nAllah and towards you because of (my) fear about those obligations \nwhich I have not discharged and for issuing injunctions which could not \nbe avoided. Do not address me in the manner in which despots are \naddressed.\n \nDo not shun me as the people of passion are (to be) shunned. Do \nnot meet me with flattery, and do not think that I shall take it ill if a true \nthing is said to me because the person who feels disgusted when he hears \nthe truth, or a just matter is placed before him, would find it more difficult \nto act upon them. Therefore, do not abstain from saying the truth or \npointing out a matter of justice because I do not regard myself to be above \nerring. I do not escape erring in my actions except that Allah helps me (in \navoiding errors) in matters in which He is more powerful than I. \nCertainly, I and you are slaves owned by Allah, besides Whom there is no \nother Lord. He owns our souls which we do not own. He took us from \nwhere we were towards the means of our prosperity. He turned our \nstraying into guidance and gave us intelligence after blindness. \nThat the innocence of angels is different from the innocence of \nman needs no detailed explanation. The innocence of angels means that \nthey do not possess the motive to sin, but the innocence of man means \nthat, although he has human frailties and passions, he possesses the power \nto resist them and is not over-powered by them so as to commit sins. This \nvery ability is called innocence and it prevents the rising up of personal \npassions and impulses. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying that he does not \nregard himself as being above erring refers to those human dictates and \npassions. His saying that Allah helps him in avoiding errors refers to his \nbeing free of them. The same tone is found in the Holy Quran in the Sura \nabout Prophet Yusuf thus: “I do not excuse myself; verily (one’s) self \n[nafs] is bent on bidding (him/her to commit) evil, except such as my \nLord has had mercy on; verily my Lord is oft-Forgiving, all-Merciful” \n(Holy Quran 12: 53). \n \nJust as in this verse, due to the existence of exceptions, the first \npart of the Imam’s statement cannot be used to argue against his being \nfree of having committed a sin. Similarly, due to the existence of the \nexception that Allah helps him to avoid errors, the first part of the \nstatement by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib cannot be used to argue against his \nbeing free of having committed any sin; otherwise, the notion of the \nProphet’s infallibility, too, would have to be rejected. In the same way, \nthe last sentence of this sermon should not be taken to mean that before \nthe proclamation of Prophethood, he had been under the influence of pre-\nIslamic beliefs, and that just as others had been unbelievers, he, too, might \nhave been in darkness and misguidance. This is so because since his birth, \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was brought up by the Prophet (h) because \nof what the effect of such upbringing had permeated him. It cannot, \ntherefore, be conceived that whoever had since infancy trodden in the \nfootprints of the Prophet (h) would deviate from the path of guidance \neven for one moment. Thus, al-Mas`udi has written the following: “Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) never believed in any god than Allah so that there \ncould be a question about his acceptance of Islam [i.e. he was always \nMuslim]. He rather followed the Prophet (h) in all his actions and \n(virtually) imitated him. In this very state he attained the most” (Muruj al-\nDhahab, Vol. 2, p. 3). \n \nHere, reference to those whom Allah led from darkness into \nguidance implies the individuals whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was \naddressing. Ibn Abul-Hadid writes the following in this regard: “The \nreference here is not to his own self because he had never been an \nunbeliever so as to have accepted Islam after that. But with these words, \nhe is referring to those group of people whom he was addressing” (Sharh \nNahjul-Balagha, Vol. 11, p. 108)."

I beseech You to take revenge on the tribesmen of \nQuraish and on those who are assisting them, for they have cut asunder \nmy kinship and over-turned my cup. They have joined together to contest \na right to which I was entitled more than anyone else. They said to me: “If \nyou get your right, that would be just, but if you are denied the right, that, \ntoo, would be just. Endure it with sadness or kill yourself in grief.” I \nlooked around but found no one to shield me, protect me or help me \nexcept the members of my family. I refrained from flinging them into \ndeath and, therefore, closed my eyes despite the dust, kept swallowing \nsaliva despite (the suffocation of) grief and endured the pangs of anger \nalthough they were more bitter than colocynth and more grievous than the \nstabs of knives. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “This utterance of Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) has already appeared in an earlier Sermon (No. 171), \nbut I have repeated it here because of the difference of versions.” \nPart of the Same Sermon about Those Who Went to Basra to \nFight Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x)\nThey marched on my officers and the custodians of the public \ntreasury, which is still under my control, and on the people of a \nmetropolis all of whom were obedient to me and were allied to me.

    "text": "Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Recited the Verse Saying, \n“Engage (Your) Vying in Exuberance until You Come to the Graves” \n(Holy Quran, 102: 1-2)1 Then Said the Following : \n \n195During the Battle of Jamal, a group of Banu Jumah was on the side \nof Aisha, yet the chief men of this group fled away from the battlefield. Some of \nthem were: Abdullah at-Tawil ibn Safwan, Yahya ibn Hakim, Amir ibn Mas`ud \nand Ayyub ibn Habib. From this group (Banu Jumah), only two men were \nkilled. \n1961. The genesis of the revelation of this verse is that the tribes of Banu \nAbd Manaf and Banu Sahm began to boast to each other about the abundance of \ntheir wealth and the number of their tribesmen. In order to prove that they had a \ngreater number, each began to include their [in the tally] dead as well, \nwhereupon this verse was revealed to the effect that abundance of riches and a \nmajority in numbers has made you some people forgetful, so much so that they \ncount the dead also with the living. This verse is also taken to mean that \nabundance of riches and progeny has made some people oblivious [of their \nreligious obligations] till they reached their graves. But the utterance of Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) supports the first meaning. \nHow distant (from achievement) is their aim, how neglectful \nthese visitors are and how difficult the affair is! They have not taken \nlessons from things which are full of lessons, but they took them from far \noff places. Do they boast on the dead bodies of their forefathers, or do \nthey regard the number of dead persons as a ground for boasting about \ntheir number?! They want to revive the bodies that have become lifeless \nand the movements that have ceased. They are more entitled to be a \nsource of admonishment than a source of pride and boasting. They are \nmore suitable for being a source of humility than of honor. \n \nThey looked at them with weak-sighted eyes, descending into the \nhollow of ignorance. If they had asked about them from the dilapidated \nhouses and empty courtyards, they would have said that they went into \nearth in the state of misguidance, and you, too, are heading ignorantly \ntowards them. You trample their skulls, raise constructions on their \ncorpses, graze what they have left and live in houses which they have \nvacated. The days (that lie) between them and you are also bemoaning \nyou and reciting eulogies over you. \n \nThey are your fore-runners in reaching the goal. They have \narrived at the watering places before you. They had positions of honor \nand plenty of pride. They were rulers and holders of positions. Now they \nhave gone into the interstice where earth covers them from above and is \neating their flesh and drinking their blood. They lie in the hollows of their \ngraves lifeless, growing no more, hidden, not to be found. The approach \nof dangers does not frighten them; the adversity of circumstances does not \ngrieve them. They do not mind earthquakes, nor do they heed thunder. \nThey are gone and not expected back. They are existent but unseen. They \nwere united but are now dispersed. They were together and are now \nseparated.\n \nTheir records are unknown and their houses are silent, not \nbecause of length of time or distance of place, but because they have been \nmade to drink the cup (of death) which has changed their speech into \ndumbness, their hearing into deafness and their movements into stillness. \nIt seems as if they are fallen in slumber. They are neighbors not feeling \naffection for each other, friends who do not meet each other. The bonds of \ntheir knowing each other have been worn out; the regards of their \nfriendship have been cut asunder. Everyone of them is, therefore, alone \nalthough they are a group; they are strangers though friends. They are \nunaware of morning after a night and of evening after a day. The night or \nthe day, when they departed, has become ever existent for them.197 Or a \nnight that would come without a day. They found the dangers of their \nplace of stay more serious than they had feared. They witnessed that its \nsigns were greater than they had guessed. The two objectives (namely \nParadise and Hell) have been stretched for them up to a point beyond the \nreach of either fear or hope. Had they been able to speak, they would have \nbecome too dumb to describe what they witnessed or saw. \n \nEven though their traces have been wiped out and their news has \nstopped, eyes are capable of drawing a lesson, as they looked at them, \nintelligent ears heard them, and they spoke without uttering words. So, \nthey said that handsome faces have been destroyed and delicate bodies \nhave been smeared by the earth. We have put on a worn-out shroud. The \nnarrowness of the grave has over-whelmed us and strangeness has spread \namong us. Our silent abodes have been ruined. The beauty of our bodies \nhas disappeared. Our known features have become hateful. Our stay in the \nplaces of strangeness has become long. We do not get relief from pain nor \nwidening from narrowness. \n \nNow, if you portray them in your mind, or if the curtains \nconcealing them are removed for you, in such a state, when their ears \nhave lost their power, turning deaf, their eyes have been filled with dust, \nsinking down, their tongues which were very active have been cut into \npieces, their hearts which were ever wakeful have become motionless in \ntheir chests, in every limb of theirs a peculiar decay has taken place which \nhas deformed it and paved the way for calamity towards it..., all these lie \npowerless, with no hand to help them, no heart to grieve over them, it is \nthen that you would certainly realize the grief of their hearts and the dirt \nof their eyes. \n \nEvery trouble of theirs is such that its condition does not change \nand the distress does not clear away. How many a prestigious body and \namazing beauty which earth has swallowed, although when in the world \nhe enjoyed abundant pleasures and was nurtured in honor? He clung to \nenjoyments (even) in the hour of grief. If distress befell him, he would \n \n197This means that for whoever dies in the day, it is always day, \nwhereas for whoever dies in the night, the darkness of night never dispels \nbecause they are at a place where there is no turning of the moon and the sun \nand no rotation of the nights and the days. The same meaning has been \nexpressed by a poet like this: \nThere is sure to be a day without a night, \nseek refuge in consolation through the pleasures of life, playing and being \nindulged in games. He was laughing at the world while the world was \nlaughing at him because of a life full of forgetfulness. Then time trampled \nhim like thorns, the days weakened his energy and death began to look at \nhim from near. Then he was overtaken by a grief which he had never felt; \nailments appeared in place of the health which he previously used to \nenjoy. \n \nHe then turned to that with which the physician had made him \nfamiliar, namely suppressing the hot (diseases) with cold (medicines) and \ncuring the cold with hot doses. But the cold things did nothing save \naggravate the hot ailments, while the hot ones did nothing except to \nincrease the coldness. Nor did he acquire temperateness in his \nconstitution. Rather, every ailment of his increased till his physicians \nbecame helpless, his attendants grew loathsome and his own people felt \ndisgusted from describing his disease, avoided answering those who \ninquired about him and quarreled in front of him about the serious news \nwhich they were concealing from him. Thus, someone would say that his \ncondition is what it is and would console them with hopes of his recovery, \nwhile another would advocate patience on missing him, recalling to them \nthe calamities that had befallen the earlier generations. \n \nIn this state, when he was getting ready to depart from the world \nand leave his beloved ones, such a serious choking overtook him that his \nsenses became bewildered and the dampness of his tongue dried up. Now, \nthere was many an important question whose reply he knew about but he \ncould not utter and many a voice that was painful for his heart that he \nheard but remained (unmoved), as though he was deaf to the voice of \neither, an elder whom he used to respect, or a youth whom he used to \ncaress. The pangs of death are too hideous to be covered by description or \nbe appreciated by the hearts of the people in this world."

With the help of the bright \nawakening of their ears, eyes and hearts did they keep reminding others of \nthe remembrance of the Days of Allah, making others fear Him with \npiety; they were like guide posts in the wildernesses. Whoever adopts the \nmiddle way, they praise his ways and give him the tidings of deliverance. \nBut whoever goes right and left, they vilify his ways and frighten him \nwith ruin. In this way, they served as lamps in the darkness and guides \nthrough these doubts. \n \nThere are some people who are devoted to the remembrance (of \nAllah). They have adopted it in place of worldly matters so that \ncommerce or trade does not turn them away from it. They pass their life \nin it. They speak into the ears of neglectful persons, warning against \nmatters regarded as unlawful by Allah, ordering them to practice justice \nwhile they themselves keep practicing it. They keep other away from \nwhat is unlawful while they themselves refrain from it. It is as though \nthey have finished the journey of this world towards the next and have \nbeheld what lies beyond it. Consequently, they have become acquainted \nwith all that befell them in the interstice during their long stay the rein and \nthe Day of Judgement fulfills its promises for them. Therefore, they \nremoved the curtain from these things for the people of the world, till it \nwas as though they were seeing what people did not see and hearing what \npeople did not hear. \n \nIf you picture them in your mind in their admirable positions and \nwell-known sittings, when they have opened the records of their actions \nand are prepared to render an account of themselves with regard to the \nsmall as well as the big things they were ordered to do but failed to do, or \nwere ordered to refrain from but they indulged therein, so they realized \nthe weight of their burden (of bad deeds) on their backs and felt too weak \nto bear them. Then they wept bitterly and spoke to each other while still \ncrying and beseeching Allah in repentance and acknowledgment (of their \nshortcomings)..., you would find them to be symbols of guidance and \nlamps in the darkness. Angels will be surrounding them, peace will be \ndescending upon them, the gates of heaven will be opened for them, and \npositions of honor will be assigned to them in the place of which Allah \nhad informed them. Therefore, He has appreciated their actions and \npraised their status. They call Him and breathe in the air of forgiveness. \nThey are ever needy of His bounty. They remain humble before His \ngreatness, the length of their grief has pained their hearts and prolonging \ntheir grief. They knock at every door of inclination towards Allah. They \nask the One Whom generosity does not impoverish and from Whom those \nwho approach Him do not get disappointed. \n \nTherefore, take account of yourself for your own sake because the \naccount of others will be taken by One other than you."

Then he said the following :.\nThe addressee (in this verse) has no argument; his excuse is most \ndeceptive. He is resigning himself to ignorance. \n \nO man! What has emboldened you to (commit) sins? What had \ndeceived you about your Lord, and what has made you satisfied with the \ndestruction of your own soul? Is there no cure for your ailment or no \nawakening from your sleep? Do you not have pity on yourself as you \nhave on others? Generally, when you see anyone exposed to the heat of \nthe sun, you cover him with a shade. Or if you see anyone afflicted with \ngrief that pains his body, you weep out of pity for him. What has then \nmade you patient over your own disease? What has made you insistent on \nyour own afflictions, and what has consoled you from weeping over \nyourself although your life is the most precious of all lives to you? Why \ndoes not the fear of an ailment that may befall you in the night keep you \nawake although you lie on the way to Allah’s wrath due to your sins? \n \nYou should cure the disease of languor in your heart with \ndetermination and the sleep of neglectfulness in your eyes with \nwakefulness. Be obedient to Allah and love His remembrance. Picture \nyourself running away while He is approaching you. He is calling you to \nHis forgiveness and concealing your faults with His kindness, while you \nare fleeing away from Him, seeking others. Certainly, Great is Allah the \npowerful Who is so generous, and how humble and weak you are yet still \nso bold to commit disobedience to Him although you live in His \nprotection and undergo changes of life in the expanse of His kindness. He \ndoes not exclude you from His kindness and does not remove you from \nHis protection. In fact, you have not been without His kindness even for \none single moment, whether it be a favor that He conferred upon you, or a \nsin of yours that He concealed, or a calamity that He has warded off from \nyou. What is your idea about Him if you had obeyed Him? By Allah, if \nthis had been the case with two persons equal in power and matching in \nmight (one being inattentive and the other showering favors upon you), \nyou would then have been the first to indict yourself of having a bad \nconduct and committing evil deeds. \n \nI truthfully say that the world has not deceived you but you have \nhad yourself deceived by it. The world opened to you the curtains and \ndivulged to you (everything) equally. And in all that, it forewarned you \nabout the troubles befalling your bodies and the decay in your power. It \nhas been too true and faithful in promise and did not speak a lie to you or \ndeceive you. There are many who advise you about it but they are \nblamed, and they speak the truth about it but they are opposed. If you \nunderstand the world by means of dilapidated and far-reaching power of \ndrawing lessons, you would find it like one who is kind to you and \ncautious about you. It is good abode for whoever does not like it as an \nabode, a good place of stay for whoever does not regard it a permanent \nhome for stay. \n \nOnly those who run away from this world today will tomorrow be \nregarded as virtuous. When an earthquake occurs, the Day of Resurrection \napproaches with all its severity, people of every worshiping place cling to \nit, while all the devotees cling to the objective of their devotion as all \nfollowers cling to their leaders. On that Day, even the act of one looking \nat the sky [wondering about what it contains and about the One Who \ncreated everything] or that of the sound of a footstep on the ground [of \none who goes to perform a good deed] will be fully rewarded through His \nJustice and Equity. On that Day, many an argument will prove void and a \ncontention for excuses will stand rejected. \n \nYou, therefore, should now adopt for yourselves the course with \nwhich your excuse may be sound and your plea may be heard. Take from \nthe transient things of this world that which will stay for you (in the next \nworld). Provide for your journey. Keep your gaze on the brightness of \ndeliverance, and prepare the saddles (for setting off)."

    "text": "About a Companion Who Passed Away from this World \nBefore the Occurrence of Troubles \nMay Allah reward such-and-such man who straightened the \ncurve, cured the disease, abandoned mischief and established the Sunnah. \nHe departed (from this world) with untarnished clothes and few \nshortcomings. He achieved the goodness (of this world) and remained \nsafe from its evils. He adhered to Allah’s obedience and feared Him as He \ndeserves to be feared. He went away leaving the people in dividing ways \nwherein the misled cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain \ncertainty. \n \nWho is this man to whom the Imam (x) is referring? Ibn Abul-\nHadid has written (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 14, pp. 3-4) that \nreference here is to another `Umar [not to caliph `Umar] and that these \nsentences have been uttered in his praise as indicated by the word `Umar’ \nwritten under the phrase ‘such-and-such’ in Sayyid ar-Radi’s own \nhandwriting in the manuscript of Nahjul-Balagha which he wrote. This \nman is identified in Abul-Hadid’s statement, but it is to be seen that if \nSayyid ar-Radi had written the word `Umar’ by way of explanation it \nshould have existed, as other explanations by him have so remained, in \nthose versions which have been copied from his manuscript. Even now, \nthere exists in Mosul University, Iraq, the oldest manuscript of Nahjul-\nBalagha written by the famous calligraphist Yaqut al-Musta’simi. But \nnobody has afforded any clue to this explanation of Sayyid ar-Radi! Even \nif the view of Ibn Abul-Hadid is accepted, it will be viewed as \nrepresentative of the personal opinion of Sayyid ar-Radi which may serve \nas a supplementary argument in support of an original argument. But this \npersonal view cannot be accorded any significance. \n \nIt is strange how two and a half centuries after the demise of \nSayyid ar-Radi, that is, in the seventh century A.H., Ibn Abul Hadid \nshould make the statement that the reference here is to `Umar and that \nSayyid ar-Radi himself had so indicated. The result: Some other \nannotaters also followed the same line. But the contemporaries of Sayyid \nar-Radi who also wrote about Nahjul-Balagha have given no such \nindication in their writings although, as contemporaries, they should have \nhad better information about Sayyid ar-Radi’s writing. Thus, allama Ali \nibn Nasir, who was a contemporary of Sayyid ar-Radi and who wrote an \nannotation of Nahjul-Balagha under the title A’lam Nahjul-Balagha, \nwrites the following with regard to this sermon: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) has praised one of his own companions for his good conduct. The man \nhad died before the troubles that arose following the death of the Prophet \nof Allah (k).”\n \nThis is supported by the annotations of Nahjul-Balagha written by \nallama Qutbu’d-Din ar-Rawandi (d. 573 A.H.). Ibn Abul-Hadid (Vol. 14, \np. 4) and ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 4, p. \n97) have quoted his following view: “By this man, Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) refers to one of his own companions who died before the \nmischief and disruption that occurred following the death of the Prophet \nof Allah (k).”\n \nAllama al-Hajj al-Mirza Habibullah al-Khoei is of the opinion \nthat the person under discussion is Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar. He \nbases his view on the ground that after the assassination of Malik, the \nsituation of the Muslim community was such as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) explains in this sermon.” \n \nAl-Khoei adds that: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has praised \nMalik repeatedly such as in his letter to the people of Egypt sent through \nMalik when he [Malik] was appointed [by Commander of the Faithful Ali \n(x)] as the provincial governor of Egypt. It is similar to his utterances \nwhen the news of Malik’s assassination reached him. He then said the \nfollowing: ‘Malik?! Who is Malik? If Malik was a stone, he was hard and \nsolid; if he was a rock, he was a great rock which had no parallel. Women \nhave become barren to give birth to such as Malik.’ Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) had even expressed in some of his utterances that ‘Malik was to \nme as I was to the Holy Prophet (h).’ Therefore, one who possesses such \na status certainly deserves such attributes and even beyond that” (Sharh \nNahjul-Balagha, Vol. 14, pp. 374-375). \n \nIf these words had been about `Umar, and if there was some \ntrustworthiness about it, Ibn Abul-Hadd will have recorded the authority \nor tradition, and it will have existed in history and been known among the \npeople. But here nothing is found to prove the statement except a few \nself-concocted events. Thus, about the pronouns in the words “khayraha \nand sharraha”, he takes them to refer to the caliphate and writes that these \nwords can apply only to one who enjoys power and authority because \nwithout authority it is impossible to establish the Sunnah or prevent the \ninnovation. This is the gist of the argument which he has advanced on this \noccasion, although there is no proof to establish that the antecedent of this \npronoun is the caliphate. It can rather refer to the world (when Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib [x] says:) “He achieved good [of this world] and remained \nsafe from its evils,” and this will be in accord with the context. Again, to \nregard authority as a condition for the safeguarding of people’s interest \nand the propagation of the Sunnah means to close the door to prompting \nothers to good and dissuading them from evil, although Allah has \nassigned this duty to a group of the people without the condition of \nauthority: “There should be among you a group [umma] who calls people \nto virtue and enjoin what is good and forbid wrong, and these shall be the \nsuccessful ones” (Holy Quran, 3: 104). \n \nSimilarly, it is transmitted that the Prophet (h) said, “So long as \npeople go on promoting righteousness and dissuading evil and assisting \neach other in virtue and piety, they will remain in righteousness.” \n \nAgain, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), in the course of a will, says \nthe following in general terms: “Establish the pillars of the Unity of Allah \nand the Sunnah, and keep both these lamps [of guidance] aflame.” \n \nIn these sayings, there is no hint that this obligation cannot be \ndischarged without authority. Facts also tell us that (despite army, force, \npower and authority) the rulers could not prevent evil, nor could they \npropagate virtue to the extent to which some unknown godly persons \nwere able to inculcate moral values by imprinting their morality on heart \nand minds, although they were not backed by any army or force, and they \ndid not have any tools of power save their way of living in destitution. \nUndoubtedly, authority and control can bend heads down before it, but it \nis not necessary that it should also pave the way for virtue in hearts. \nHistory demonstrates that most of the rulers destroyed the features of \nIslam. Islam’s existence and progress have been possible, thanks to the \nefforts of those helpless persons who possessed nothing save poverty and \ndestitution.\n \nIf it is emphasized that the reference here should only be to a \nruler. But why should it not be taken to refer to a companion of Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) who had been a provincial governor, such as Salman al-\nFarsi for whose burial Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) made the trip all the \nway to al-Mada’in, and why is it not possible that Imam Ali ibn AbÅ\nTalib (x) might have uttered these words after the burial as a comment on \nhis life and way of governing Mada’in? However, to believe that they are \nabout Umar [ibn al-Khattab] is without any proof whatsoever. In the end, \nIbn Abul-Hadid quotes the following statements of (the historian) al-\nTabari to back his hypothesis: “It is related from al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah \nthat when Umar died, Ibn Abu Khath’amah said crying, ‘O Umar! You \nwere the man who straightened the curve, removed the ills, destroyed \nmischief, revived the Sunnah, remained chaste and departed without \nentangling [yourself] in evils’.” According to al-Tabari, al-Mughirah \nrelated saying, “When Umar was buried, I came to Ali and I wanted to \nhear something from him about `Umar. So, on my arrival, Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) came out in this state: He was wrapped in one cloth after \nbathing and was jerking the hair of his heard and beard. He had no doubt \nthat the Caliphate would come to him. On this occasion he said, ‘May \nAllah have mercy on Umar ibn Abu Khath’amah. He has correctly said \nthat he enjoyed the good things of the Caliphate and remained safe from \nits evils. By Allah! He did not say it himself but was made to say it” (al-\nTabari, Vol. 1, p. 2763; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 12, p. 5; Ibn Kathir, Vol. 7, \np. 140). \n \nThe relater of this event is al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah who was \nsaved from the penalty of having committed adultery with Umm Jamil by \n`Umar [ibn al-Khattab] despite the testimony against him. His openly \nabusing Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in Kufa under Mu`awiyah’s behest \nare admitted facts of history. On this ground, what weight his statements \ncan carry is quite clear. From the factual point of view also, this story \ncannot be accepted. Al-Mughirah’s statement that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) had no doubt about his Caliphate runs contrary to the facts. \nWhat were the factors from which he made this assumption when the \nactual facts were to the contrary? If the Caliphate was certain for anyone \nat the time, Othman was then the caliph. Thus, at the Consultative \nCommittee, Abd ar-Rahman ibn `Awf said to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x), “O Ali! Do not create a situation against yourself, for I have observed \nand consulted the people and they all want Othman” (al-Tabari, Vol. 1, p. \n2786; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, p. 71; Abul-Fida’, Vol. 1, p. 166). \n \nConsequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was sure not to be \nmade the caliph as has already been stated on the authority of al-Tabari’s \nTarikh, under the sermon of the Camel’s Foam (ash-Shaqshaqiyya). In \nother words, on seeing the names of the members of the Consultative \nCommittee, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) told al-Abbas ibn `Abdul-\nMuttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except to Othman \nsince all the powers had been given to Abd ar-Rahman ibn `Awf who was \nOthman’s brother-in-law (sister’s husband) and Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas \nwas a relative and tribesman of `Abd ar-Rahman. These two would \ncollaborate to give the caliphate to him. \n \nAt this stage, the question arises as to why al-Mughirah urged \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to say something about `Umar. If he knew \nthat Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had good impressions about Umar, he \nshould have also known his own. But if he thought that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) did not entertain good impressions about him, then the purpose \nof his asking Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to do so would be none other \nthan that whatever he might say he would. By speaking his mind, an \natmosphere against him would be created, and he would make the \nmembers of the Consultative Committee suspicious of him. The views of \nthe members of the Consultative Committee are well understood from the \nvery fact that by putting the condition of following the conduct of the first \ntwo Caliphs for electing the caliph, they thus demonstrated their \nadherence to and preference of both men. In these circumstances, when \nal-Mughirah tried to play this trick, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said just \nby way of relating a fact that `Umar achieved the good (of this world) and \nremained safe from its evil. This sentence has no connotation of praise or \ncensure. `Umar did in his days enjoy all kinds of advantages, while his \nperiod was free from the mischief that cropped up soon thereafter. Having \nrecorded this statement, Ibn Abul-Hadid writes the following: “From this \nevent, the belief gains momentum that in this utterance, the allusion is \ntowards Umar.” \n \nIf the utterance refers to the statement of Ibn Abu Khat’amah \nabout which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has said that they were not the \nheart’s voice of the man but he was made to utter them, then there is no \ndoubt that the reference was to `Umar. But the view that these words were \nuttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in praise of `Umar [ibn al-Khattab] \nis not at all established. Rather, from this incident, it is evidently proven \nthat these words were uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah. Allah alone knows \non what ground the words of Ibn Abu Khath’amah are quoted. Yet some \npeople dare to argue that these words were uttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) about `Umar...!\n \nIt seems that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had uttered these words \nabout someone on some occasion, then Ibn Abu Khath’amah used similar \nwords on Omer’s death. Yet even then, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words \nwere taken to be in praise of Umar! Otherwise, no mind except a \nderanged one can argue that the words uttered by Ibn Abu Khath’amah \nshould be interpreted as being said by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in \npraise of `Umar. Can it be expected, after (a glance at) the sermon of the \nCamel’s Foam, that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) might have uttered these \nwords? Again, it is worth considering whether these words had been \nuttered by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) on `Omer’s death, then at the \nConsultative Committee, when he refused to follow the conduct of the \n(first) two Caliphs, it should have been said to him that only the other day \nhe has said that `Umar had established the Sunnah and put an end to \ninnovations. So, since his conduct was in agreement with the Sunnah, \nwhat was the sense in accepting the Sunnah but refusing to follow his \nown conduct?!"

    "text": "Causes of Differences in the Features and Traits of People \nDi’bil al-Yamami has related from Ahmed ibn Qutaybah, and the \nlatter from Abdullah ibn Yazid, and he from Malik ibn Dihyah who said, \n“We were with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) when a discussion arose \nabout the differences among men (in features and conduct), so Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: \nThey differ among themselves because of the sources of their clay \n(from which they have been created). This is so because they are either \nfrom salty soil or sweet soil or from rugged earth or soft earth. They \nresemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their soil and differ \naccording to its difference. Therefore, sometimes a person of handsome \nfeatures is weak in intelligence, a tall stature person is of low courage, a \nvirtuous person is ugly in appearance, a short stature person is far-sighted, \na good-natured person has an evil trait, a person of perplexed heart has a \nbewildering mind and a sharp-tongued person has a wakeful heart. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has ascribed the differences in \nfeatures and characters of people to the differences in the clay from which \nthey are created and according to which their features are shaped and their \ncharacters are formed. Therefore, to the extent that their clay of origin is \nakin, their mental and imaginative tendencies, too, will be similar, and to \nthe extent by which they differ, there will be a difference in their \ninclinations and tendencies. By “origins” of a thing are meant those things \non which its coming into existence depends, but they do not have to be its \ncause. The word “teen” is the plural of “teenah” which means “origin” or \n“basis”. Here, “teenah” means semen which, after passing through various \nstages of development, emerges into a human shape. Its origin means \nthose constituents from which those items are created which help in the \nformation of semen. Thus, by salty, sweet, soft or hard soil, the reference \nis to these elementary ingredients. Since those elementary ingredients \ncarry different properties, the semen growing out of them will also bear \ndifferent characteristics and propensities which will (eventually) show \nforth in the differences in features and in the conduct of those born out of \nit.\n \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 13, p. \n19) that the phrase “origins of teenah” implies those preservative factors \nwhich are different in their properties as Plato and other philosophers \nhave held. The reason for calling them “origins of teenah” is that they \nserve as an asylum for the human body and prevent the elements from \ndiffusion. Just as the existence of a thing hinges on its essence, in the \nsame way the existence of this body, which is made up of elements, \ndepends on preservative factors. So long as the preservative factor exists, \nthe body, too, is safe from disruption and disintegration and the elements \nare also immune to diffusion and dispersal. When it leaves the body, the \nelements also get dispersed. \n \nAccording to this explanation, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words \nwill mean that Allah has created different original elements of which \nsome are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are \nstrong. Every person will act according to his/her original element. If \nthere is any similarity in the inclinations of two persons, it is attributed to \ntheir original element. In it, they are similar. And when their tendencies \ndiffer, it is because their original elements are not similar. But this \nconclusion is not correct because Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words do not \nonly refer to differences in conduct and behavior but also in features and \nshapes. The differences of features and shapes cannot be the result of \ndifferences in original elements. \n \nIn any case, whether the original elements make up the cause of \ndifferences in features and in one’s conduct, or whether the elementary \ningredients are the cause, these words appear to lead to the negation or \nvolition [of such an assumption]. They attempt to prove the dominance, \nthe upper-hand, (of destiny) over human actions. If man’s capacity for \nthinking and acting is dependent on one’s “teenah”, then he will be \ncompelled to behave himself in a fixed way on account of which he will \nneither deserve praise for good deeds nor be held blameworthy for bad \nones. But this hypothe sis is incorrect because it is well established that \njust as Allah knows everything in creation after its coming into being, in \nthe same way, He knew it before its creation. Thus, He knew what actions \nman would perform of his free will and what he could leave. Therefore, \nAllah gave him the ability to act according to his free will and created him \nfrom a suitable “teenah”. This “teenah” is not the cause of his actions so \nas to snatch away from him his free will. But the meaning of creating \nfrom suitable “teenah” is that Allah does not by force stand in man’s way \nbut allows him to tread the path which he wants of his own free will."

    "text": "Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Relating His Own Condition \nafter the Prophet’s Migration till Their Meeting \nI began to follow the path adopted by the Prophet (h) and tread \non the tracks of his remembrance till I reached al-Arj. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s \nwords “faata’u dhikrahu” constitute the highest forms of brevity and \neloquence. He means to say that he was being given news about the \nProphet (h) from the commencement of his setting out till he reached \nthis place, and he has expressed this notion in this wonderful expression.” \n \nSince the inception of Prophethood, the Prophet (h) remained in \nMecca for thirteen years. For him, this period was one of the most severe \noppression and destitution. The unbelievers from the Quraish tribe had \nclosed all the doors of livelihood against him, sparing no means to inflict \nhardship upon him, so much so that in order to put an end to his life, they \nbegan plotting with each other as to how to do so. Forty of their \ndignitaries assembled in the hall of audience (Dar an-Nadwa) for \nconsultation and decided that one individual should be picked out from \nevery tribe, then they would jointly attack him. In this way, Banu Hashim \nwould not dare to face all the other tribes, and the matter would quiet \ndown on the payment of blood money. To give a practical shape to this \nscheme, these people lay in ambush near the house of the Prophet (h) on \nthe night of the first of Rabi’al-Awwal. As the Prophet (h) slept in his \nbed, he was to be thus attacked. On one hand, the preparation for killing \nhim was complete. On the other hand, Allah informed him of all the \nintrigues of the unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish, commanding him to let \nAli (x) sleep in his bed while he himself had to immigrate to Medna. The \nProphet (h) sent for Ali (x). Disclosing to him his plan, he said the \nfollowing: “Ali (x)! Lie in my bed.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) inquired: \n“O Messenger of Allah! Will your life be saved by my sleeping here?” \nThe Prophet (h) said, “Yes.” Hearing this, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nperformed a prostration as a token of thanks-giving and, exposing himself \nfully to the danger, lay on the Prophet’s bed while the Prophet (h)\ndeparted. The unbelieving tribesmen of Quraish were peeping and getting \nready for the attack. Abu Lahab said, “It is not proper to attack in the \nnight because there are women and children also living in the house. \nWhen the morning dawns, you should attack him, but keep watch during \nthe night lest he should not move and go anywhere else.” Consequently, \nthey kept their eyes on the bed throughout the night and soon. When dawn \ndrew nigh, they proceeded stealthily. Hearing the sound of their footsteps, \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) removed the covering from his face and \nstood up. The tribesmen of Quraish gazed at him with disbelieving eyes \nas to whether it was an illusion or a fact. After making sure that it was \nAli, they inquired, “Where is Muhammad (h)?” Ali replied, “Did you \nentrust him to me so that now you are asking me about him?!” They had \nno reply. Men ran to pursue him but found footprints only up to the cave \n[of Hira] in themountain of Thawr. Beyond that, there were neither \nfootprints nor any sign of hiding in the cave. They came back bewildered \nwhile the Prophet (h), after staying in the cave for three days, left for \nMedina. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) passed these three days in Mecca, \nreturned to the people their properties which they had entrusted the \nProphet (k) to safeguard for them then set off towards Medna to join the \nProphet (h). Up to al-Arj, a place between Mecca and Medina, he kept \ngetting news about the Prophet (h) and he maintained his anxious march \ntill he finally met the Prophet (h) at Quba on the twelfth of Rabi’ al-\nAwwal where the Prophet (k) was waiting for him, refusing to enter \nMedina without him (al-Tabari, Tafsir, Vol. 9, pp. 148-151; Tarikh, Vol. \n1, pp. 1232-1234; Ibn Sa`d, Al-Tabaqat, Vol. 1, Part. 1, pp. 153-154; Ibn \nHisham, As-Sira, Vol. 2, pp. 124-128; Ibn al-Athir, Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. \n4, p. 25; Al-Kamil, Vol. 2, pp. 101-104; Ibn Kathir, Tafsir, Vol. 2, pp. \n302-303; Tarikh, Vol. 3, pp. 180-181; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 13, pp. 303-\n306; al-Sayyuti, Al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. 3, pp. 179-180;’allama al-\nMajlisi, Bihar al-Anwar, Vol. 19, pp. 28-103)."

A man should fear Allah while he \nis given a life to lead up to his death and is given time to act. A man \nshould control himself by the rein and hold it with its bridle.

To belittle them and keep them away from \nauthority has been considered as the greatest service to Islam. If Othman’s open \nmisdeeds had not given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes \nthere will have been no question of allegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and \ntemporal authority will have retained the same course as it had so far followed. \nBut all those who could be named for the purpose had no courage to come \nforward because of their own shortcomings while Mu`awiyah was sitting in his \ncapital away from the center. In these circumstances there was none except Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) who could be looked at. Consequently people’s eyes \nhovered around him and the same common people who, following the direction \nof the wind, had been swearing allegiance to others jumped at him for swearing \nallegiance. Nevertheless, this allegiance was not on the count that they regarded \nhis Caliphate as from Allah and him as an Imam (The Divine Leader) to obey as \nobligatory. It was rather under their own principles which were known as \ndemocratic or consultative. However, there was one group who was swearing \nallegiance to him as a religious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined \nby Allah. otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other Caliphs and \nas regarding precedence, on the fourth status, or at the level of the common men \nafter the three caliphs. Since the people, the army and the civil servants had been \nimpressed by the beliefs and actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their \nways whenever they found anything against their liking they fretted and frowned, \nevaded war and were ready to rise in disobedience and rebellion. Furthermore, \njust as among those who fought in jihad on the side of the Prophet (h), there \nwere some seekers of this world and others of the Hereafter. Now, in the same \nway, there was no dearth of worldly men who were, in appearance, with Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) but actually they had connections with Mu`awiyah who has \npromised some of them positions and had extended to others temptation of \nwealth. To hold them as Shi`as of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and to blame \nShi`ism for this reason is closing the eyes to facts because the beliefs of these \npeople will be the same as of those who regarded Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nfourth in the series.

The \nswarming majority did not bear that belief about him which was obligatory to \nhave. They gave precedence to the previous Caliphs over him and held that the \ncriterion of precedence was Caliphate. In this matter, those coming later followed \nthe predecessors and argued that if the predecessors had not the knowledge that \nthe previous Caliphs had precedence over Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) they will \nnot have preferred them to him. Rather, these people knew and took Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) as a citizen and subject.
