    "text": "Addressed to the people of Kufa at the time of his march from \nMedina to Basra .\nFrom the servant of Allah, Ali, the Commander of the Faithful, to \nthe people of Kufa who are the foremost among the supporters and the \nchiefs of the Arabs. \n \nI am reminding you of what happened to Othman so that its \nmemory may be like seeing its events. People criticized him, and I was \nthe only man from among the Muhajirun (immigrants) to ask him to make \nit his pursuit to please (the Muslims) the most and to offend them the very \nleast. As for Talhah and az-Zubayr, their lightest step about him was hard, \nand their softest voice was strong. Aisha, too, was angry with him. \nConsequently, a group overpowered him and killed him. Then, people \nswore allegiance to me, not by force or compulsion, but obediently and \nout of their free will. \n \nYou should know that Medina has been vacated by its residents \nwho have abandoned it. It is boiling like a huge cauldron and rebellion is \nfixed on its axis, moving with full force. So, hasten towards your amir \n(commander) and proceed forward to fight your enemy, if Allah, to \nWhom Might and Majesty belong, so wills. \n \nIbn Maythmam writes (in Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 4, p. 338) \nthat when on hearing about themischief-mongering of Talhah and az-\nZubayr, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) set off for Basra. He sent this letter \nto the people of Kufa through Imam al-Hassan and Ammar ibn Yasir from \n[the town of] al-Maa’al-Adhb, while ibn Abul-Hadid has written (in \nSharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 14, pp. 8, 16; al-Tabari, Vol. 1, p. 3139, and \nibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, p. 223) that when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\ncamped at ar-Rabadha, he sent this letter through Muhammad ibn Ja`far \nibn Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. In this letter, Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) clearly sheds a light on the point that the assassination of \nOthman was the result of the efforts of Aisha, Talhah and az-Zubayr, and \nthat it was they who played a major role in it. In fact, Aisha went beyond \nher bounds and exposed his shortcomings in public meetings, ordering \nthat he should be killed. Thus, Shaikh Muhammad Abdo has written the \nfollowing: “Once, Othman was on the pulpit when Umm al-Mu’minin \n[mother of the faithful] Aisha took out the shoes and the shirt of the \nProphet (h) from under her outer covering mantle and said the following: \n‘These are the shoes of the Messenger of Allah and his shirt. They have \nnot yet decayed while you have altered his religion and changed his \nSunnah.’ Upon this, heated words were exchanged between them \nfollowing which she said, ‘Kill this Na’thal’, likening Othman with a \nknown long-bearded Jew (of that name)” (Nahjul-Balagha, printed in \nEgypt, Vol. 2, p. 3; also see Ansab al-Ashraf, Vol. 5, p. 88; Abul-Fida’, \nVol. 1, p. 172). \n \nPeople were already displeased with Othman, so this event \nincreased their boldness. They, hence, surrounded his mansion so that he \nmight mend his ways or abdicate from the caliphate. In these \ncircumstances, there was serious apprehension that if he did not accept \neither of the two alternatives, he would be killed. All this was observed by \nAisha, but she paid no heed to it and, leaving him under siege, she \ndecided to leave Medina for Mecca. On this occasion, Marwan ibn al-\nHakam [her cousin] and Attab ibn Asd said the following to her, “If you \npostpone your departure, it is possible his [‘Othman’s] life may be saved \nand this crowd [laying siege around his mansion] may disperse,” \nwhereupon she said that she had decided to go for hajj and that that could \nnot be changed. It was then that Marwan recited this couplet by way of a \nproverb:\n \nQays set fire to my cities, and when they were ablaze, \n \nHe slipped away, saving himself clear of it. \n \nSimilarly, Talhah and az-Zubayr were also very angry with him \nand they were in the vanguard of those fanning this fire, intensifying the \nopposition to his caliphate. From this angle, they were, to a great extent, \ntaking part in the assassination and were responsible for shedding his \nblood. Other people also knew them in this light and regarded them as his \nmurderers, while their supporters, too, were not able to offer any \nexplanation (for absolving them). Thus, Ibn Qutaybah writes that when al-\nMughrah ibn Shu’bah met Aisha at Awtas, he asked her the following \nquestion: “O Umm al-Mu’minin! Where are you bound for?” She replied, \n“I am going to Basra.” He inquired for what purpose and she replied, “To \navenge Othman’s murder.” He said, “But his assassins are with you!” \nThen he turned to Marwan and inquired where he was going. He replied \nthat he, too, was going to Basra. He inquired about the purpose and the \nreply was: “To avenge Othman’s murder.” Then he again said, \n“`Othman’s assassins are with you. These Talhah and az-Zubayr have \nkilled him” (Al-Imama wal-Siyasa, Vol. 1, p. 60). \n \nIn any case, when, after laying the blame on Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x), this group that had killed `Othman reached Basra, Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) also rose to quell this mischief; he wrote this letter to the \npeople of Kufa to solicit their support. Upon this, their combatants and \nwarriors rose in large numbers and enlisted in his army. They faced the \nenemy with full courage which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) also \nacknowledged. Thus, the letter hereafter is in acknowledgment."

    "text": "Written to the People of Kufa after the Victory in Basra\nMay Allah reward you, townsmen (of Kufa), on behalf of a \nmember of your Prophet’s family, with the best reward that He bestows \non those who act in obedience to Him and on those who thank Him for \nHis bounties. Surely, you heard (me) and obeyed, and when you were \ncalled upon, you promptly responded. \nDocument 3 \nWritten to Shurayh ibn al-Harith (al-Kindi), Kufa’s Judge \nIt is related that Shurayh ibn al-Harith (al-Kindi), who was Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib’s Qadi (judge) of Kufa, during his tenure, bought a \nhouse for eighty dinars. When it became known to Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x), he sent for him saying: \n I have come to know that you have purchased a house for eighty \ndinars and that you have written a document [deed of ownership] for it \nand put testimony on it.” \nShurayh replied, “Yes, O Imam ibn Abu Talib; it is so.” Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) cast an angry look at him and said: \n \nO Shurayh, beware, shortly one person (the angel of death) will \ncome to you who will not look at the document, nor will he question you \nabout your testimony but take you out of it far away and deposit you in \nyour grave quite alone. Look, O Shurayh! If you have purchased this \nhouse from money other than yours, or paid the price from an unlawful \nsource, you have incurred on your soul the loss of this world as well as of \nthe next. If you had come to me at the time of purchase, I would have \nwritten for you a document on this paper, then you would have liked to \npurchase the house even for one dirham, not to speak of more. That \ndocument is this: \n \nThis is about a purchase made by a humble slave (of Allah) from \nanother slave ready to depart (for the next world). He has purchased a \nhouse out of houses of deceit in the area of mortals and in the \nneighborhood of mortals. This house has four boundaries as follows: The \nfirst boundary is contiguous to sources of calamities; the second boundary \nadjoins the sources of distress; the third boundary adjoins devastating \ndesires, and the fourth boundary adjoins deceitful Satan, and it is towards \nthis that the door of this house opens. This house has been purchased by \none who has been waylaid by desires from one who is being driven by \ndeath at the price of leaving the honor of contentment and entering into \nthe humility of want and submissiveness. If the buyer encounters some \n(evil) consequences of this transaction, then it is for the one who \ndismantles the bodies of monarchs, snatches the lives of despots, destroys \nthe domain of Pharaohs, Kisras200, Caesars201, Tubbas202 and Himyars203\n \n200“Kisra” is the Arabized word of Khusraw [Khosroe] which means “a \nking whose domain extends to a vast area”. This was the title of the rulers of \nthen Persia. \n201“Caesar” was one of the rulers of Rome. In Latin, it means the child \nwhose mother dies before delivery and who is extracted by cutting her body \nopen. Since among the Kings of Rome, Augustus was born like this, he was \nknown by this name. Thereafter, this word was adopted as the title of every \nruler. \n202“Tubba’” is an appellation of each of the Kings of Yemen who had \nHimyar and Hadramawt under his control. Their names have been mentioned in \nthe Holy Quran in 44:37 and 50:14. \n203Himyar was an important tribe in the ancient Sabaen kingdom of \nsouth-western Arabia. Later in time, its kings were the powerful rulers of much \nof southern Arabia from c. 115 BC to c. AD 525. The Himyarites were \nconcentrated in the area known as Thu Raydan (later called Qataban) on the \n and all those who amass wealth upon wealth and go on \nincreasing it, who build high houses and decorate them and collect \ntreasures and preserve them, as they claimed according to their own \nthinking, for children to take them to the place of accounting and \njudgement and the status of reward and punishment. “When the verdict \nwill be passed those who stood on falsehood will then be the losers” \n(Holy Quran, 40: 78). \n \nThis document is appreciated by intelligence when free from the \nshackles of desire and from the adornments of this world."

Thus, they were probably aided in the overthrow of \ntheir Sabaean [or Sabian] kinsmen by the discovery of a sea route from Egypt to \nIndia which deprived the inland Sabaean kingdom of its former importance as a \ncenter for offshore trade. The Himyarites (classical Homeritae) inherited the \nSabaean language and culture and from their capital at Zafar, their power at \ntimes extended eastward as far as the Persian Gulf and northward into the \nArabian Desert. At the beginning of the 4th century AD, the Himyarite capital \nwas moved northward to San’a. Later in the same century, both Christianity and \nJudaism gained firm footholds in the area.

In it, he \ninstructed him that in case the enemy was bent on fighting and he had to face it, \nhe should not enlist on his side those who on the one hand showed consideration \nfor the personalities of `}’isha, Talhah and az-Zubayr and who, on the other \nhand, had agreed to fight against them merely by persuasion because such \npeople could not be expected to fight steadfastly nor could then be depended"

It is not for you to be oppressive \ntowards the subjects, nor to put your life at risk save on strong grounds. \nYou have in your hands the funds which are the property of Allah to \nWhom belong Might and Majesty, and you hold its charge till you pass it \non to me. Probably I will not be one of the bad rulers for you, and this is \nthe end of the matter. \n \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was through with the Battle of \nJamal, he wrote to al-Ash`ath ibn Qays (al-Kindi), who had been the \nGovernor of Azerbaijan since the days of Othman, to send the revenue \nand levies of his province to him [in Kufa]. But since al-Ash’ath had fears \nabout the future of his status and assignment, he intended to pocket all \nthis money like other officers appointed by Othman. Therefore, as soon as \nthis letter reached him, he sent for his chief associates. Having mentioned \nthis letter to them, he said the following: “I fear that this money will be \ntaken away from me; I, therefore, intend to join Mu`awiyah.” It was then \nthat those people said that it was a matter of shame to leave the kith and \nkin and to seek refuge with Mu`awiyah. Consequently, on the advice of \nthose people, he postponed the implementation of his idea to run away, \nbut he did not agree to part with the money. On getting this information, \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent Hijr ibn Adiy al-Kindi to bring the man \nto him to Kufa. He persuaded him and brought him to Kufa. On reaching \nthere, his kit was found to contain four hundred thousand Dirhams out of \nwhich Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) left thirty thousand for the man and \ndeposited the rest in the public treasury."

    "text": "To Mu`awiyah (ibn Abu Sufyan) \nVerily, those who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and \nOthman have sworn allegiance to me on the same basis on which they \nswore allegiance to them. Whoever was present had no choice (to \n \nupon. Rather, such people will try to discourage others, too. Therefore, it was \nonly good to ignore such people. \nconsider), and whoever was absent had no right to reject, and consultation \nwas confined to the Muhajirun and the Ansar. If they agree on an \nindividual and take him to be the Caliph, it will be deemed to imply \nseeking Allah’s pleasure. If anyone keeps away by way of demonstrating \nhis objection or for innovation, they will return him to the status from \nwhere he kept away. If he refuses, they will fight him for following a \ncourse other than that of the believers, and Allah will put him back from \nwhere he had run away. By my life, O Mu`awiyah, if you see with your \nbrain without any passion, you will find me the most innocent of all with \nregard to Othman’s blood, and you will surely know that I was in \nseclusion from him, unless you conceal what is quite open to you. Then \nyou may commit an outrage (on me) as you like, and that is the end of the \nmatter.\n \nWhen all the people of Medina swore allegiance to Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x), Mu`awiyah refused to go along, fearing his own power \nbeing jeopardized and to contest Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s caliphate. He \nconcocted the excuse that it had not been agreed upon unanimously and \nthat, therefore, after canceling it, there should be another general election, \nalthough the caliphate from which (the process of) election was started \nwas the result of a timely situation. There was no question about the \ncommon vote so it could be called the result of the people’s election. \nRather, it was imposed on the people and assumed to be their verdict. \nFrom then, it became a principle that whoever the nobles of Medna\nelected will be deemed to represent the entire world of Islam; nobody \nwould be allowed to question it, whether he was present at the time of \nelection or not. In any case, after the establishment of this principle, \nMu`awiyah had no right to propose a re-election nor to refuse the \nswearing of allegiance when he had in practice recognized these \ncaliphates which, it was alleged, had been settled by the important people \nof Medina. That is why when he alleged this election was unbinding, \nrefusing to swear allegiance, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) pointed out to \nhim the (recognized) way of election and smashed his argument. It was a \nmethod known as arguing with the adversary on the basis of his wrong \npremises so as to refute his argument, since Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nnever at any stage regarded consultation (with the chiefs) or the common \nvote to be the criterion of validity of the caliphate. Otherwise, with regard \nto the caliphate, about which it is alleged that they were based on the \nunanimity of the Muhajirun and the Ansar, he would have regarded that \nunanimity of vote as a sound authority, holding it as valid. But his refusal \nof the swearing of allegiance in the very first period, which could not be \ndenied by anyone, is a proof of the fact that he did not regard these self-\nconcocted methods as the criterion of (validity of) the caliphate. That is \nwhy at all times he continued pressing his own case for the caliphate, \nwhich was also established on the basis of the Prophet’s statements and \nactions. However, to place it before Mu`awiyah meant opening the door \nto questions and answers. He, therefore, attempted to convince him of his \nown premises and beliefs so that there could be no scope for interpretation \nnor for confusing the matter. In fact, the real objective of Mu`awiyah was \nto prolong the matter so that at some point his own authority might gain \nsome support."

    "text": "To Mu`awiyah \nOur people (the tribesmen of Quraish) decided to kill our Prophet \n(h) and to uproot us. They caused us many worries, behaved with us \nharshly, denied us the ease of life, exposed us to fear, forced us to seek \nrefuge in a rugged mountain and ignited for us the flames of war. \n \nAllah then gave us determination to protect His religion and \ndefend His honor. The believers among us expected (heavenly) rewards \nfrom so doing, and the unbelievers among us gave their support because \nof kinship. Those who accepted Islam from among the tribesmen of \nQuraish were away from the distresses in which we were involved either \nbecause of a pledge that protected them or because of the tribe that would \nrise to support them. They were, therefore, safe from being killed. The \nway with the Prophet (h) was that when fighting became fierce and \npeople began to lose ground, he would send forward members of his \nfamily and through them protect his companions from the attacks with \nswords and spears. In this way, `Ubaydah ibn al-Harith was killed on the \nDay of Badr, Hamzah (ibn `Abdul-Muttalib) on the Day of Uhud, and \nJa`far (ibn Abu Talib) on the Day of Mu’tah. One more person, whom I \ncan name if I wish, desired to seek martyrdom as they did, but their deaths \napproached, while his had not. \n \nHow strange it is that I am being grouped with him who never \nhad a briskness of pace like mine, nor had he, to his credit, any \nachievement like mine unless he claims something of which I do not \nknow. In any case, all praise belongs to Allah. \n \nAs regarding your request to hand over to you the murderers of \nOthman, I have contemplated over this matter and I do not find that \nhanding them over to you or to someone else is possible for me. By my \nlife, if you do not give up your wrong ways and disruptive deeds, you \nwould surely know them. They would shortly be seeking you and would \nnot give you the trouble of seeking them on land, sea, mountains or \nplains. But this search would be painful for you and their visit would not \ngive you happiness. Peace be on those whoever deserves it. \n \nWhen the Messenger of Allah (k) was commanded (by Allah) to \ncall people to (believe in) the Unity of Allah, the powers of unbelief and \ndisobedience stood up to block the way of truthfulness and the tribes of \nQuraish decided to quell this voice through coercion and force. Love for \ntheir idols was so strong in the hearts of these unbelievers, they were not \nprepared to hear a single word against them. The idea of one God was \nenough to rouse their passions. In addition, they were made to hear such \nepithets about their gods that gave them no better status than lifeless \nstones. When they realized that their principles and beliefs were in \njeopardy, they prepared themselves to trouble the Prophet (h). They got \nready to try every means to reach that end. They adopted such pain-\ninflicting devices (against the Prophet [h]) that it was impossible for him \nto step out of his house. Those who had accepted Islam during this period, \ntoo, had to face continuous tribulations. For example, these adherents to \nsuch beliefs were often placed on the burning ground, under the parching \nsun, and beaten with straps and stones till they lost their consciousness. \nWhen the atrocities of the tribesmen of Quraish rose to this extent, the \nProphet (h) permitted such adherents to leave Mecca and immigrate to \nAbyssinia in the fifth year since his call to Prophethood. The tribesmen of \nQuraish followed them there as well, but the ruler of Abyssinia refused to \nhand the believers over to them. Through his fairness and justice, he did \nnot permit any trouble to befall them. \n \nOn the other side of the sea, the Prophet’s preaching continued. \nThe magnetism and influence of truth was producing its effect. People \nwere impressed by his teachings and personality. They came into his fold \nas a result of which the tribesmen of Quraish felt much perturbed, so they \ntried to stop this increasing influence and power. When they could not do \nanything, they decided to sever all ties with Banu Hashim and BanÅ\nAbdul-Muttalib, to have no social contacts with them, and to have no \ntransactions with them, perhaps they would be forced to give up \nsupporting the Prophet (h), then they would deal with him as they \npleased. Consequently, they concluded a mutual agreement about it, and a \ndocument was written on the subject and was deposited safely. After this \nagreement, although the locality was the same and the inhabitants, too, \nwere the same, yet for Banu Hashim every nook and corner became \nstrange and well-known faces turned as if they had never known each \nother. All of them turned their faces and stopped mutual meetings and \ncontacts. In these circumstances, there was also the apprehension that the \nProphet (h) might be attacked suddenly in a valley outside the city. For \nthis reason, they were forced to take refuge in a place called Shi’b \n(quarter) of Abu Talib. At this stage, those Banu Hashim who had not yet \naccepted Islam shared these privations on account of lineal kinship and \noffered defence at the hour of need, while those who had accepted Islam, \nsuch as Hamzah and Abu Talib, were actively protecting the Prophet (h)\nas their religious obligation. In particular, Abu Talib had given up all his \nease and comfort, spending his days consoling the Prophet (h) and his \nnights changing his bed from one place to another. Thus, if the Prophet \n(h) used a bed one night, the next night Ali was to sleep in it, so that in \ncase someone attacked, Ali should suffer the brunt instead. \n \nThis was a period of great privation and trouble for Banu Hashim. \nIf they could get leaves of trees to eat, that was enough for them; \notherwise, they had to near their starvation. After the lapse of three years \nin these hardships, Zuhayr ibn Abu Umayyah (whose mother was ‘Atika \ndaughter of Abdul-Muttalib), Hisham ibn Amr ibn Rabi`ah (who had a \nfamily maternal kinship with Banu Hashim), al-Mut’im ibn `Adiy ibn \nNawfal ibn Abd Manaf, Abul-Bakhtari al-As ibn Hisham ibn al-Mughirah \nand Zama’ah ibn al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib proposed that this agreement \nshould be abrogated. For a discussion of this issue, the chiefs from among \nthe tribesmen of Quraish assembled in the precincts of the Ka`ba. No \ndecision had yet been taken when Abu Talib came out of the Valley and \njoined them. He said to them, “My nephew Muhammad (h) has told me \nthat the paper on which this agreement was written has been eaten by \nwhite-ants and nothing in it has remained save the name of Allah. So, you \nshould send for the document and see it. If he is correct, then you should \ngive up your animosity, and if he is wrong, I am ready to hand him over \nto you.” The document was brought and examined. It was, indeed, a fact \nthat with the exception of the words “In Your name, O God”, written on \nthe top of all documents in those days, the rest of it had been eaten away \nby white-ants. Seeing this, al-Mut’im ibn `Adiy tore off the writing; thus, \nthis cruel agreement was abrogated. At last, Banu Hashim abandoned the \nlife of oppression and helplessness. But even after this, there was no \nchange in the unbelievers’ behavior towards the Prophet (h). Rather, \nthey were so keen in their enmity and malice against him that they started \nthinking of taking his life away. Consequently, the great event of Hijra \n(migration of the Holy Prophet [h] from Mecca to Medina) took place. \nAlthough on this occasion Abu Talib was no longer alive, Ali represented \nhim by lying down on the Prophet’s bed; it was the lesson taught by Abu \nTalib through which he managed to protect the Holy Prophet’s life. \n \nAlthough these events were not unknown to Mu`awiyah, yet by \nrecounting to him the deeds of his predecessors, the intention was to \nawaken his malicious spirit. Therefore, his attention has been drawn to the \nhardships inflicted (on the Holy Prophet [h] and his adherents) by the \ntribesmen of Quraish, especially Banu Abd Shams, so that he might see \nthe conduct of each of the followers of the truth and the followers of \nfalsehood would then realize that he himself was treading on the right \npath or just following his forefathers."

I am surely treading on that very highway which \nyou had willingly forsaken then was forced to adopt. \n \n205This is in reference to the following verse: “We sent no warner into \nany city except that its men who lived in ease (and luxury) said, ‘We disbelieve \nin the message with which you have been sent’” (Holy Quran, 34: 34). \nYou think that you have come out seeking revenge for Othman’s \nblood. Certainly, you know how Othman’s blood was shed. If you want to \navenge it, avenge it there. It is as though I see that when war is cutting \nyou with its teeth, you cry like camels moaning under heavy loads. And it \nis as though I see your party bewildered by the incessant striking of the \nswords, the occurrence of death, and the falling of bodies after bodies, \ncalling me towards the Holy Quran although they would themselves be \neither unbelievers, deniers of the truth or renegades of allegiance after \nhaving sworn it. \n \nThis previous prediction of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) is about \nthe battle of Siffin. Herein, he has depicted the whole picture in very few \nwords. Thus, on one side Mu`awiyah was bewildered on account of the \nattacks of the Iraqis and was thinking to run away while, on the other, his \narmy was crying under the constant onslaught of death. Eventually, when \nthere was no way to escape, they raised the Holy Quran on the spears and \nshouted for peace. By this device, the remaining persons saved their lives. \n \nThis prediction, as ibn Abul-Hadid al-Mu’tazili says, “is either a \ntrue prophetic keen eye of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), which signifies a \ngreat power, or it is an information through knowledge of the unknown \n(ilmul-ghayb) which is the most significant and wonderful. However, \nboth cases are in the state of extreme significance and beauty. \n \nIbn Abul-Hadid has further quoted the same prediction from other \nletters of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to Mu`awiyah (Sharh Nahjul-\nBalagha, Vol. 15, pp. 83-85). \n \nThis prediction cannot be attributed to imagination, to guessing or \nto the drawing of inference from events, nor can these details be \nascertained by wit or far-sightedness. Only he could disclose them whose \nsource of information is either the Prophet’s own revelation-bearing \ntongue or the Divine inspiration. \n \n \nInstruction 11 \nGiven to the Contingent Sent to Confront an Enemy\nWhen you proceed towards your enemy, the status of your force \nshould be on the approaches of high grounds or edges of mountains or \nbends of rivers, so that it may serve you as a place to return to. Your \nencounter should be from one side or from two. Position scouts on the \npeaks of mountains and the raised sides of the high ground so that the \nenemy may not approach you from any place, whether of danger or of \nsafety. And be admonished that the vanguard of an army serves as their \neyes and the eyes of the vanguard are their informers. Beware of \ndispersal. When you halt, do so collectively, and when you move, you \nshould move together. When night comes, fix your spears in a circle and \ndo not sleep except for dosing or napping. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) put Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi and \nShurayh ibn Hani al-Harithi in command of contingents of eight thousand \nand four thousand strong at the camp of an-Nukhayla, ordering them to \nadvance towards Syria. A dispute arose then between them about their \nranks. They informed Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) of it and wrote letters \nof complaints about each other. In reply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nwrote to them that when they marched jointly, the command of the joint \nforce would be with Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi, and if they marched \nseparately, each commander would be in charge of his own force. \n \nIn this letter, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) also wrote certain \ninstructions for them. Here, Sayyid ar-Radi takes down only the portion \ncontaining the instructions. These instructions are not only useful as \nregards the strategies of fighting in those days, but their utilization and \nimportance in bringing out the principles of fighting in our days as well is \nundeniable. These instructions are: At the time of encounter with the \nenemy forces, the assailants should camp on tops of mountains and curves \nof rivers. This way, the low areas of the rivers would serve as trenches \nand the peaks of mountains as the walls of the fortress; thus, it would be \npossible to feel secure and face the enemy from the other side. Secondly, \nthe attack should be from one side or at the most from two because by \ndistributing the entire force on several fronts, weakness would be \ninevitable. Thirdly, the scouts should be placed on the tops of high \ngrounds and the peaks of mountains so that they may give a warning of \nany attack. Sometimes, it happens that instead of attacking from the \nexpected side, the enemy attacks from a different one. Therefore, if posses \nare on high places, they will detect the enemy from the cloud of dust seen \nfrom a distance. \n \nTo clarify the useful aspect of these instructions, Ibn Abul-Hadid \nhas recorded (in Vol. 15, p. 91) a historical incident that when Qahtabah \n(ibn Shabib at-Ta’i) camped in a village after leaving Khurasan, he and \nKhalid ibn Barmak went and sat on the top of a nearby hill. No sooner \nhad they sat down than Khalid noticed flocks of deer coming running \nfrom the forest. On seeing this he said to Qahtabah, “O Commander! \nStand and announce to the army that they should at once fall in line and \ntake up arms.” Hearing this, Qahtabah was startled. He stood up. Looking \nhither and thither, he said, “I do not see the enemy’s men anywhere.” He \nreplied, “O Amir! This is not the time that should be lost in any \nconversation. You have seen how these deer are proceeding towards the \npeople, leaving their abodes. This means that the enemy’s army is \nmarching from the rear.” Consequently, the commander ordered his army \nto get ready. As soon as the army got ready, the noise of the horses’ hoofs \nwas heard and within moments the enemy was on them. Since they had \nprepared themselves for defence in time, they defended themselves \nagainst the enemy thoroughly. Now, if Khalid had not been at such a \nheight and had not acted with such sagacity, the enemy would have \nattacked them as they were unaware of the attack and annihilated them. \nFourthly, the reconnaissance should be spread here and there, so that they \ncan be aware of the movements and intentions of the enemy and thereby \nfoil his plans. Fifthly, when the army camps, it should camp together, and \nwhen it moves, it should move together, so that the enemy does not attack \nyou in a state of dispersal and overpowers you easily. Sixthly, at night, the \nguard should be formed by fixing spears in a circle in the ground so that if \nthe enemy attacks during the night, it is possible to prepare for defense by \ntaking up arms at once, and if the enemy showers arrows, that, too, can be \ndealt with. Seventhly, deep sleep should be avoided lest you should \nbecome unaware of the enemy’s approach and the latter would succeed in \nattacking you before you get ready. \nInstruction 12 \nGiven to Ma`qil Ibn Qays ar-Riyahi as He Was Dispatched to \nSyria at the Command of a Vanguard Contingent of Three Thousand \nStrong.\nFear Allah before Whom attendance is inevitable and with other \nthan Whom there is no meeting. Do not fight except those who fight you. \nTravel in the two cool periods (i.e. morning and evening). Let the men \nhave a midday sleep. March easily and do not travel during the early night \nfor Allah has made it for resting and has ordained it for staying, not for \njourneying. Therefore, give rest to your body in the night and let your \nbeasts of burden also rest. When you are sure that the morning has \napproached, and when dawn has drawn nigh, start your journey with \nAllah’s blessings. If you face the enemy, stand in the midst of your \ncomrades. Do not get too near to the enemy like one who wants to \ncommence the fighting, nor should you remain too distant like one who is \nafraid of action, till you receive my orders. Hatred for them should not \nlead you to fight before inviting them (to guidance) and exhausting your \npleas before them."

    "text": "To Two Officers in His Army \nI have placed Malik1 ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar in command over \nyou and over all those under you. Therefore, follow his commands and \ntake him as the armour and shield for yourselves because he is one of \nthose from whom I have no fear of weakness nor any mistake, nor \nlaziness where haste is more appropriate,nor haste where slackness is \nexpected of him. \n \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent a vanguard contingent of \ntwelve thousand strong under the command of Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-\nHarithi and Shurayh ibn Hani al-Harithi to Syria, on the way, near Sur ar-\nRum, they encountered “Abul-Awar” Amr ibn Sulayman al-Salami who \nwas camping there with a Syrian contingent. Both of them informed \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) of this through al-Harith ibn Jumhan al-Ju’fi, \nwhereupon the Imam (x) sent Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar as the \nOfficer-in-Command and wrote this letter to notify them. The brief but \ncomprehensive words in which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) refers to \nMalik al-Ashtar in this letter gives an indication of his intelligence, \nsagacity, courage, daring, expanse and versatility in the art of war as well \nas his own personal greatness. \nIinstruction 14\nTo the Army Before the Encounter with the Enemy at Siffin \nDo not fight them unless they start the fighting because, by the \ngrace of Allah, you are right, and to leave them till they begin fighting \nwill be another point from your side against them. If, by the will of Allah,\nthe enemy is defeated, do not kill those who flee away, do not strike a \nhelpless person, do not finish off the wounded and do not inflict pain on \nwomen even though they may attack your honor with filthy words and \nabuse your officers because they are weak in character, mind and \nintelligence. We have been ordered to avoid them although they may be \nunbelievers. Even in pre-Islamic (jahiliyya) period, if a man struck a \nwoman with a stone or a stick, he was rebuked along with his posterity \nafter him.. \n \nThe responsibility for the war and fighting that took place \nbetween Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and Mu`awiyah lies solely on \nMu`awiyah because the latter brought about the war by laying the blame \nfor Othman’s blood on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) erroneously, although \nthe facts about the causes of Othman’s killing and by whom he was killed \nwere not unknown to Mu`awiyah. But since there was no way for him to \nachieve his objective save by creating an excuse for war, he started the \nwar in order to retain his illegitimate authority. This evidently was \noffensive. It cannot by any means be considered as permissible because \nrebellion and rebellion against the rightful Imam is unlawful according to \nthe general consensus of Muslims. Thus, “Abu Zakariyya” Yahya ibn \nSharaf an-Nawawi (631/1233 - 676/1277) writes the following: “Do not \nfight those in authority with regard to matters of governing, nor should \nyou raise objections against them except when you observe them \ncommitting things which you know are definitely against Islam. If you see \nthem doing such things, regard it as bad for them and speak the truth \nwherever you may be. But rising against them or fighting them is \nprohibited by the consensus of Muslims (Sharh Sahih Muslim, Vol. 2, p. \n125). In agreement with this view, see also: judge Abu Bakr Muhammad \nibn at-Tayyib al-Baqillani [338/950 - 403/1013], the Ash`arite great \nscholar, in Al-Tamhid, p. 186, and Sa`d ad-Din Mas`ud ibn Umar at-\nTaftazani [712/1312 - 793/1390] in Sharh al-Maqasid, Vol. 2, p. 272. \n \nMuhammad \nibn \n`Abdul-Karm \nal-Shahristani \nwrites \nthe \nfollowing: “Whoever rises against the true Imam, according the \nunanimous view of the (Muslim) community, is known as a Kharijite, \ndeviator. The same is the case of rising, during the days of the \ncompanions, against the rightful imams, or even after them against those \nwho followed them in virtue (Al-Milal wal Nihal, Vol. 1, p. 114). \n \nThere is no doubt that the action of Mu`awiyah’s was the result of \nhis rebellion. To take up arms for the purpose of stopping the advance of \nthe one who rebellions is not against any code of peace or against the \nconduct of peace-loving people. Rather, it is a natural right of the \noppressed. And if one is deprived of this right, then there will remain no \nway to prevent oppression and tyranny or the safeguarding of rights in the \nworld. This is why Allah has permitted taking up arms against rebels. \nThus, Allah says the following: “And if two parties of the believers fall \ninto a quarrel, restore peace between them both; but if one of the two \ntransgresses against the other, (then) fight that which transgresses till it \ncomplies with the command of Allah. And if it complies, restore peace \nbetween the two with justice and deal justly; verily, Allah loves the just \nones” (Holy Quran, 49: 9). \n \nIt was the first plea to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) pointed \nout by saying, “By the Grace of Allah, you are right.” But even after \nexhausting this plea, he prevented his army from taking the initiative to \nfight because he wished that the initiative should not be from his side and \nthat he should take up the sword only in self-defense. Consequently, when \nall his effort for peace proved futile, and when the enemy took the first \nstep towards war, this was the second argument in their own favor after \nwhich Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) could not be blamed for getting \nfighting nor be accused of taking an aggressive action. It was rather an \nobligation to stop oppression and tyranny that he had to discharge and \nwhich Allah has permitted in clear words. Thus, Allah’s command is that: \n“Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not be aggressive \nfor verily Allah does not love the aggressors” (Holy Quran, 2: 190). \n \nBesides, fighting Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) meant fighting the \nProphet (h) according to the Prophet’s saying: “O Ali! Your peace is my \npeace and your war is my war (Ibn al-Maghazlii, Al-Manaqib, p. 5; Ibn \nAbul-Hadid, Vol. 18, p. 24). Thus, whatever punishment should be \nimposed for fighting the Prophet (h) should be for fighting Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x). For him, whoever wages war against the Prophet (h),\nAllah has laid down the same penalty. \nTo recompense those who wage war against Allah and His \nMessenger and strive in the land, spreading mischief (therein), is only \nthat they be slain or crucified or their hands and feet should be cut off \nfrom opposite sides or be banished from the land; This for them shall be \nthe disgrace in this world and for them, in the hereafter, shall be a great \ntorment. (Holy Quran, 5: 33) \n \nApart from this, the instructions that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nissued with regard to the war, namely that no runner-away nor the \nwounded should be assaulted, are so high from the moral point of view \nthat they can be regarded as a sublime specimen of the moral values and \nhigh standards of the struggle to promote Islam. These instructions, then, \nwere not simply confined to mere words. Rather, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) followed them to the letter, ordering others, too, to follow them \nstrictly. He did not, on any occasion, tolerate the chasing of any runner-\naway, the attack against the helpless or to assault women. In fact, on the \nbattlefield of the Jamal war, where the command of the opposite force \nwas in the hands of a woman, he did not change his principle. After the \ndefeat and the conquering of the foe, he proved his high character, \nsending Aisha to Medina under due protection. Had there been someone \nother than Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), he would have proposed the same \npunishment as that which ought to be awarded for making such a step! \nThus, Ibn Abul-Hadid has written the following: “Had she [Aisha] done \nthe same to (caliph) Umar as she had done to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x),\nspreading rebellion against him among the people, and having the caliph \nsecured victory over her, he would have killed her and cut her into pieces. \nBut Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was very forbearing and large-hearted” \n(Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 17, p. 254). \nInvocation 15 \nBy Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) When He Used to Face the \nEnemy.\nO Lord! Hearts are drawn to You, necks are stretching (towards \nYou), eyes are fixed (on You), steps are in motion and bodies have turned \nlean! O Lord! Hidden animosity has become manifest and the cauldrons \nof malice are boiling. \n \nO Lord! We complain to You of the absence of our Prophet (h), \nthe numerousness of our enemy and the diffusion of our passions. \n“Our Lord! Decide between us and our people with truth; You are \nthe Best of those who decide” (Holy Quran, 7: 89). \nInstruction 16 \nHe Used to Issue this Instruction to His Followers During \nThe retreat after which return is intended and the withdrawal after \nwhich an attack is in view should not make you unhappy. Do justice with \nthe swords (allow your swords to do their duties). Keep ready a place for \nthe falling of bodies (of your foe); prepare yourselves for hurling strong \nspears and striking swords with full force, and keep your voices down as \ndoing so keeps cowardice off. \n \nBy the One Who broke open the seed (for growth) and created \nliving beings, they had not accepted Islam but had only secured safety (by \nverbally professing it), hiding their lack of faith. Consequently, when they \nfound helpers for their lack of faith, they disclosed it."

    "text": "In Reply to a Letter from Mu`awiyah. \nAs for your demand to me to (hand over) Syria, I cannot give you \ntoday what I denied you the day before. As regarding your statement that \nthe war has eaten up Arabia save its last breath, you should know that \nthose whose right has been eaten up will go to Paradise, whereas those \nwho are wrong shall go to Hell. As for your equality in war and in (the \nnumbers of) men, certainly you cannot be more penetrating in \ndoubtfulness (of belief) than I am in certainty (of belief), and the people \nof Syria are not more greedy for this world than the people of Iraq are for \nthe next one. \n \nAs for your saying that both of us are sons of Abd Manaf, it is \nundoubtedly so, but Umayyah cannot be like Hashim, nor can Harb be \nlike `Abdul-Muttalib, nor can Abu Sufyan be like Abu Talib. The muhajir \n(immigrant) cannot be a match for whoever was set free (when Mecca \nfell), nor can one of a pure descent be a match for one who is adopted, nor \nthe pursuer of truth can be a match to the adherent to wrongdoing, nor can \na believer be a match for a hypocrite... How bad are the successors who \nBattle Time. \ngo on following their predecessors who have already fallen into the fire of \nHell!\n \nBesides, we also have the distinction of Prophethood among us \nby virtue of which we subdued the strong and raised up the downtrodden. \nWhen Allah made Arabia enter (the fold of) His religion and when the \n[Arab] people submitted to it willingly or unwillingly, you were among \nthose who entered the religion either out of greed or out of fear, at a time \nwhen those who had gone first had preceded and when the first Muhajirun \nhad acquired their own distinction. \n \nNow, do not give Satan have a share in you, nor should you let \nhim have his sway over you, and that is an end of the matter. \n \nDuring the battle of Siffin, Mu`awiyah again considered \ndemanding the province of Syria from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and \nplaying such a trick in order to succeed in his schemes. In this regard, he \nconsulted Amr ibn al-As. But the latter did not agree with this idea and \nsaid, “O Mu`awiyah, think a little! What effect would this writing of \nyours have on Ali? How can he fall in this trap by your persuasion?” To \nthis, Mu`awiyah said, “We are all descendants of `Abd Manaf. What \ndifference is there between Ali and me that he may score over me and I \nmay not succeed in deceiving him?” `Amr ibn al-As said, “If you think \nso, then write and see (the outcome).” \n \nMu`awiyah, therefore, wrote a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) wherein he made a demand for Syria and also wrote the following: \n“We are descendants of Abd Manaf. There is no distinction for one over \nthe other among us.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) wrote this letter in \nreply. He mentioned his own predecessors along with those of \nMu`awiyah, expressing his rejection of the claim of such an equality. \nAlthough the origin of both was the same, and although the paternal chain \nof both joined at `Abd Manaf, the progeny of `Abd Shams was the source \nof all evil when it came to morality and character, involving itself in \nheresy and vice. Contrariwise, the house of Hashim was the one where \nAllah was worshiped as the only god and where there were no idols. If the \nbranches growing out of the same root bear both flowers as well as thorns, \nthen both cannot be deemed as equal. Consequently, it does not need any \ndetailed explanation to argue that Umayyah and Hashim, Harb and \nAbdul-Muttalib, and Abu Sufyan and Abu Talib did not match each other \nfrom any angle whatever. This is not denied by any historian or \nbiographer. In fact, after this reply, even Mu`awiyah did not dare to refute \nit: After Abd Manaf, it was Hashim alone who possessed conspicuous \nprestige among the tribesmen of Quraish and the most important positions \nwith relationship to the Ka`ba, namely the siqaya (i.e. providing water for \nthe pilgrims) and rifada (making provisions for the pilgrims) was assigned \nto him. As such, during the time of hajj, one caravan after another used to \ncome and stay with him. He was such a generous host to them that those \nwho partook of his generosity and benevolence praised him for a long \ntime thereafter. \n \nThe worthy son of this very large-hearted and courageous father \nwas Abdul-Muttalib whose name was Shaybah and surname was \n“Sayyidul-Batha” (master of the Mecca Valley). He was the successor to \nthe distinction of Abraham’s line and owner of the greatness and \nmastership of Quraish. The high courage and far-sightedness \ndemonstrated by him before Abraham is a shining star for the family of \nAbd Manaf. Abd Manaf was a pearl and Abdul-Muttalib was the luster of \nthe pearl. \n \nAbdul-Muttalib’s son was Abu Talib whose lap served as the \ncradle for Abdullah’s orphan child and as the place where the Prophet \n(h) was raised. He raised the Prophet (h) in his care, shielding him \nagainst his enemies. To compare Abu Sufyan, Harb and Umayyah with \nthem or to regard them as their matches is the same as to close one’s eyes \nto the luster of light and to regard it as darkness. \n \nAfter recounting this genealogical difference, the next point of \ndistinction which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) describes is that he himself \nis a muhajir (immigrant from Mecca) while Mu`awiyah is a taliq (i.e. one \nof those whose lives the Prophet [h] had spared when Mecca fell to the \nMuslims). Therefore, when the Prophet (h) entered Mecca victoriously, \nhe inquired from the tribesmen of Quraish as to how they thought he \nwould deal with them. All said that, being a generous son of a generous \nfather, they expected only goodness from him, whereupon the Prophet \n(h) said, “Go away, you have all been spared.” That is, “You did deserve \nto be detained as slaves but, by obligation, you have been set free.” These \nspared persons included Mu`awiyah and Abu Sufyan. Thus, Ibn Abul-\nHadid and Shaikh Muhammad Abdo have recorded the following note in \ntheir annotations to this letter: “Abu Sufyan and Mu`awiyah were both \namong the spared ones” (Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 17, p. 119; `Abdoh, Vol. \n3, p. 17). \nThe third point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s \nlineage is pure and clear and there is no doubtful point anywhere in it. \nContrariwise, Mu`awiyah has used to the word “taliq”. Men of letters \nhave given “taliq” this meaning: “One who is attributed to someone who \nis not his father”. In this regard, the first doubt entertained about \nUmayyah is whether he was the son of Abd Shams or simply his slave \nwho began to be known as his son because of having been brought up by \nhim. Thus, allama al-Majlisi has related the following from Kamil al-\nBahai: “Umayyah was a Byzantine slave of `Abd Shams. When the latter \nfound him intelligent and sagacious, he freed him then adopted him as his \nson. The result was that he began to be called ‘Umayyah son of `Abd \nShams’ as Zayd (ibn Harithah) was called ‘Zayd ibn Muhammad (h)’\nbefore a Quranic verse was revealed (prohibiting it).” \n \nThe second doubt in the Umayyad lineage is whether Harb, who \nis known as the son of Umayyah, was really his son or simply a slave \nbrought up by him. In this regard, Ibn Abul-Hadid has quoted the \nfollowing from Abul-Faraj al-Isbahani’s bookt: “Mu`awiyah inquired \nfrom the lineage expert Daghfal (Ibn Hanzalah) whether he had seen \nAbdul-Muttalib. The genealogist replied in the affirmative. He further \ninquired how he found him, whereupon Daghfal replied, “He was \nprestigious, handsome and a man of a broad forehead, while his face bore \nthe brightness of Prophethood. Then, Mu`awiyah inquired whether he had \nseen Umayyah ibn Abd Shams also and he replied that he had seen him, \ntoo. He inquired how he found him, so he replied, “Weak of body, bent \nstature and blind.” In front of him was his slave Thakwan who led his life \nhere and there. Mu`awiyah said it was his son Abu Amr (Harb), \nwhereupon he said, “You say so but the tribesmen of Quraish only know \nthat he was his slave” (Al-Aghani, Vol. 1, p. 12; Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, \nVol. 17, pp. 231-232). \n \nIn this regard, the third doubt is about Mu`awiyah himself. Thus, \nIbn Abul-Hadid has written that: “Mu`awiyah’s mother, Hind, led a life of \nvileness and immorality.” Az-Zamakhshari (Abul-Qasim Mahmud ibn \nUmar [467/1075 - 538/1144]) has written in his book Rabi’ al-Abrar that \nMu`awiyah’s parentage was traced back to four persons who were: \nMusafir ibn Abu Amr, Omerah ibn al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah, al-Abbas \nibn Abdul-Muttalib and as-Sabah (a singer for Omerah)” (Sharh Nahjul-\nBalagha, Vol. 1, p. 336). \n \nThe fourth point of distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nhas stated that he was always the devotee of what is right while \nMu`awiyah was the devotee of wrongdoing. This fact needs no proof. The \nlife of Mu`awiyah was spent in suppressing right and hankering after \nwrong. Nowhere is his step seen as advancing the cause of righteousness. \n \nThe fifth distinction is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was a \nbeliever whereas Mu`awiyah was a mischief-monger and a hypocrite. Just \nas there can be no doubt about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s belief, there can \nbe no doubt about Mu`awiyah’s mischief-mongering and hypocricy. \nThus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has exposed the man’s hypocrisy in the \nearlier writing of these words. \n \nThese people had not accepted Islam but only secured safety by \nverbally professing it and had hidden their disbelief. Consequently, when \nthey found helpers for their mischief, they disclosed it."

This is why the \ntreatment of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s officer of them was not the same as it \nwas with Muslims. Disgusted with this [discrimination], they wrote a letter of \ncomplaint to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and spoke of the officer’s harshness. In \nreply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) wrote to his officer that he should mete out \ntreatment to them in which there should be neither harshness nor such leniency \nwhich they may exploit to creating mischief. This is so because if they are let \nloose, they get involved in schemes against the government, thus disturbing the \ncountry’s administration by creating one mischief or another, while a wholly \nrepressive policy cannot be justified because they are counted as subjects and \ntheir rights as such cannot be ignored. \n208“Ibn Abih” means: “son of his [unknown] father”. \nI truthfully swear by Allah that if I come to know that you have \nmisappropriated the funds of the Muslim, small or big amounts, I shall \ninflict upon you such punishment that would leave you empty-handed, \nheavy backed and humiliated, and that is the end of the matter."

    "text": "To Abdullah ibn Abbas. Abdullah ibn Abbas used to say, \n“Apart from the Prophet’s statements, I did not derive a greater \nbenefit from any other statement.” \nLet it be known to you that sometimes a man gets pleased with \nsecuring a thing which he was not going to miss at all and gets displeased \nat missing a thing which he would not in any case get. Your pleasure \nshould be about what you secure with regard to your next life, and our \ngrief for having lost you should be for what you miss in respect thereof. \nDo not be very much pleased with what you secure from this world, nor \nshould you get extremely grieved over what you miss of it. Your worry \nshould be about what is to come after death. \nWill 23 \nMade Shortly Before His Death When He Had Been Fatally \nWounded by a Blow from the Sword of (`Abd Ar-rahman) Ibn \nMuljim (The Curse of Allah Be Upon Him).\nI enjoin you, as my dying wish, not to regard anything as a \npartner with Allah, not to disregard the Sunnah of Muhammad (h).\nEstablish these two pillars and light these two lamps. You will then be \nfree from evil. Yesterday, I was your companion. Today, I am (just) a \nlesson for you, while tomorrow I shall be leaving you. If I survive, I shall \nbe the master of my blood (to avenge or not to avenge it), and if I die, \nthen death is a promised event. If I forgive, it is for me a means of \nnearness (to Allah) and for you a good deed. Therefore, do forgive. \n“What?! Do not you love that Allah should forgive you?” (Holy Quran, \n24: 22). \n \nBy Allah! This sudden death is not an event that I dislike, nor is it \nan accident that I hate. I am just like a night traveller who reaches the \nspring (in the morning), or like or seeker who secures (his aim): “And \nwhatever is with Allah is the best for the righteous” (Holy Quran, 3: 198). \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “A portion of this statement \nhas already appeared in the sermons, but I found it necessary to record it \nagain because of some additional matter.” \nWill 24 \nImam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Will Regarding How His Property \nShould Be Dealt With. He Wrote it upon His Return from Siffin. \n \nThis is what Ali ibn Abu Talib, the slave of Allah, has laid down \nabout his property, seeking Allah’s pleasure, so that He may, by its virtue, \ngrant him entry into Paradise and accord him peace. \nAn excerpt from the same: \nIt will be administered by [my oldest son] Hassan ibn Ali (x). He \nwill take from it a suitable portion for his own livelihood while also \nspending of it on charity. If something happens to Hassan and Hussain (x)\nsurvives him, he (Hussain [x]) will administer it after Hassan and deal \nwith it accordingly. In the charitable estate of the two sons of Fatima (x),\nthey have the same rights as all (other) sons of Ali. I have laid down the \n(functions of) administration of the two sons of Fatima (x) in order to \nseek the pleasure of Allah and nearness to the Messenger of Allah (k)\nwith due regard for his honor and in consideration of his kinship [to \nthem]. \nIt is obligatory on him who administers it to retain the estate as it \nis and to spends the surplus as he has been required and instructed. He \nshould not sell the seedlings in the plantations of these villages till the \nland changes its face by turning them into [fully grown] plants. As for \nthose of my slave girls, if any of them has a child or is pregnant, she \nwould be retained for the sake of the [birth of the] child and will partake \nof his share. If the child dies and she survives, then she is free; bondage is \nremoved from her and emancipation is granted to her.209\n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “In this will, in Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib’s phrase ‘alla yabi’a min nakhliha wadiyyatan’, the word \nwadiyyah means ‘seedling of a date-palm’, and its plural is wadiyy. And \nhis words ‘hatta tushkila arduha ghirasan’ is one of the most eloquent \nform of expression, and it means that when a number of date plants grow \non the land, then whoever had seen it before the growth will now regard it \nas a different land.” \n \n \nInstruction 25 \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) used to write the following to \nwhoever he appointed for the collection of zakat and charities. Al-\nSharif says the following: \n \n209The life of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was that of a laborer or a \ncultivator, and he dug up a number of wells, too. He worked in agricultural \nfields belonging to other persons. He cultivated barren and untilled lands, \nproviding means of irrigating to them, making them cultivable, and he planted \norchards. Since these lands were entirely cultivated by him, they were his \nproperty, yet he never paid heed to property and, declaring them a trust, gave up \nhis proprietorship. But in consideration of his kinship to the Prophet (k), he \nassigned the management rights of this trust to Imam Hassan and Imam Hussain \n(x), one after the other. Yet he did not tolerate granting any additional rights for \nthem but treated them both like other children of his, giving them merely the \nright to take from their inheritance only what was needed for their livelihood. \nThe balance he ordered to be spent for the common good of the Muslims and for \ncharitable purposes. Thus, Ibn Abul-Hadid writes the following: “Everyone \nknows that in Medina, Yanbu’ and Suwayqah, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had \ndug up several springs and brought under cultivation many barren and \nuncultivable lands. Yet, he gave up his rights of their possession, declaring them \nas trusts for the Muslims. When he left the world, nothing remained behind him \nas his property” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 15, p. 146). \n“We have recorded a few portions of it here to show that he \nalways erected the pillars of right and created examples of justice in all \nmatters, small or big, delicate or serious.” \nMove on with the fear of Allah Who is One and has no partner. \nDo not frighten any Muslim. Do not pass over anyone’s land so as to \nmake him feel unhappy. Do not take from him more than Allah’s share in \nhis property. When you go to a tribe, you should get down at its watering \nplace instead of entering their houses. Then proceed towards them with \npeace and dignity till you stand among them. Salute them and do not be \nnegligent in greeting them. After that, say to them, “O servants of Allah! \nThe vicegerent of Allah and His caliph has sent me to you to collect from \nyou Allah’s share of your properties. Is there anything of His share in \nyour properties? If so, give it to His vicegerent.” \n \nIf someone among them says, “No,” then do not repeat the \ndemand. If someone speaks to you in the affirmative, go with him without \nfrightening him, threatening him, pressuring him or oppressing him. Take \nwhat he gives you, such as gold or silver (coins). If he has cattle or \ncamels, do not enter upon them save with his permission because their \nmajor part is his. When you get there, do not enter upon them like one \nwho has full control over them or in any violent manner whatsoever. Do \nnot scare any animal. Do not tease anyone, and do not let the owner feel \ngrieved over anything. \n \nDivide the property into two parts and let the owner choose one. \nOnce he has chosen, do not object to it. Then divide the remaining into \ntwo parts and let him choose one. Once he has chosen, do not raise any \nobjection. Continue like this till only that much remains which is enough \nto satisfy Allah’s dues. Then take Allah’s due from it. If he contends your \naction, allow his views to prevail, then mix the two (separated) parts and \nrepeat what you had done before till you take Allah’s due from his \nproperty. Do not take any old, decrepit, broken-limbed, sick or unsound \nanimal. Do not entrust the animals except to one whom you trust to take \ncare of Muslims’ property till he hands it over to their chief who will \ndistribute it. Do not entrust it to anyone except to whoever is a well \nwisher, God-fearing, trustworthy and watchful, to one who is not harsh \nwith regard to Muslims’ property. Nor should you make them run too \nmuch, nor should you expose them to exhaustion, nor should you over-\nwork them. Then send us all that you have collected. We shall deal with it \nas Allah has ordered. \nWhen your trustee takes over (the animal), tell him that he should \nnot separate the she-camel from its young and should not milk all its milk \nbecause that will affect its young. Also, he should not exert it in riding. In \nthis matter, he should deal justly with it and with all its companions. He \nshould give rest to the [tired] camels and drive with ease those whose \nhoofs have been rubbed off. When you pass a water spring, keep the \ncamels there to drink and do not take them away from a vegetated land to \nbarren paths. He should allow them rest now then and give them time near \nthe water and the grass. In this way, when they reach us by leave of Allah, \nthey will be fat with plenty of marrow and will not be fatigued or \ndistressed. We will then distribute them according to the (commands of) \nthe Books of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (h). Certainly, this \nwill be a great source of reward for you and a means to secure guidance, \nif Allah so wills. \n \n \nInstruction 26 \nGiven to One of His Officers Whom He Sent for the \nCollection of Zakat and Charities. \nHe (Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib [x]) ordered him to fear Allah in his \nsecret matters and hidden actions, where there is no witness except the \nOne and only Who watches over all. He also orders him that whatever he \ndoes in obedience to Allah openly should not be different from what he \ndoes secretly. Anyone whose hidden attitude is not different from his \nopen one and whose action is not different from his words has discharged \nhis obligation and his adoration is pure. \n \nHe also ordered him that he should not harass the public. He \nshould not be harsh to them and should not turn away from them because \nof the superiority of his official status over them because they are all \nbrethren in faith and assist in the recovery of taxes: \nCertainly, you have a fixed share and a known right in this levy, \nand there are others who are poor, weak and starving. We shall discharge \nyour rights. So, you should [first] discharge their rights. If you do not do \nso, you will have the largest number of enemies on the Day of Judgement. \nHow wretched is the man whose enemies in the view of Allah are \ntheneedy, the destitute, the beggars, the turned away, the indebted and the \n(penniless) travellers?! Whoever treats the trust lightly, indulges in \ntreachery and does not keep himself and his faith untarnished by it has \ncertainly secured humiliation in this world while his humiliation and \ndisgrace in the next world will be much greater. Surely, the greatest \ntreachery is the treachery against the Muslim community, and the most \nugly deceit is deceiving the Muslim leaders, and that is the end of the \nmatter.\n \n \nInstruction 27 \nGiven to Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr (May Allah Be Pleased \nwith Him), When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x) Appointed Him as \nGovernor of Egypt: \nDeal humbly with the public. Remain lenient. Meet them large-\nheartedly, accord them equal treatment so that the mighty should not \nexpect injustice from you in their favor and the lowly should not be \ndespondent of your justice. Allah, the Sublime, will certainly question \nyou, O community of His creatures, about your actions, small or big, open \nor concealed. If He punishes you, it is because you have been oppressive, \nand if He forgives you, then it is because He is the most Generous. \n \nBe informed, O servants of Allah, that the God-fearing share the \njoys of this transient world as well as those of the next, for they share with \nthe people of this world in their worldly matters while their people did not \nshare with them in the matters of the next. They lived in this world in the \nbest manner of living. They ate the choicest food and enjoyed herein all \nthat the people with ease of life enjoyed. They secured from it what the \nhaughty and the vain secured. Then they departed from it after taking \nprovision enough to take them to the end of their journey, having \ncontracted a profitable transaction. They tasted the pleasure of renouncing \nthe life in this world, firmly believing that on the Coming Day, they will \nbe neighbors of Allah, where their call will not be repulsed, nor will their \nshare of pleasure be small. \n \nO servants of Allah! Fear death and its measures, and prepare all \nthat is needed for it. It will come as a big event and a great affair, either as \nsomething good in which there will never be any evil, or an evil one in \nwhich there will never be any good. Who is nearer to Paradise than one \nwho works towards it, and who is nearer to Hell than one who works for \nit? You are being chased by death. If you stop, it will catch you, and if \nyou run away from it, it will grab you. It is more attached to you than \nyour own shadow. Death is tied to your forelocks while the world is being \nwrapped up from behind you. Therefore, fear the Fire whose hollow is \ndeep, whose flames are severe and whose punishment is novel. It is a \nplace wherein there is no mercy. No call is heard in it. No pain is healed \nin it. If it is possible for you to have severe fear of Allah and to rest hope \nin Him, then do both these things because every individual can have hope \nin His Lord to the extent of his fear of His Lord. Certainly, the most \nhopeful person with Allah is whoever fears Him the most. \n \nO Muhammad son of Abu Bakr! Be informed that I have given \nyou charge of Egypt which is my biggest force. You are duty-bound to \noppose your passions and to serve as a shield against your religion even \nthough you may get only an hour in the world. Do not enrage Allah for \npleasing others because (Allah) is such that He may take the place of \nothers, yet others cannot take the place of Allah. Say prayers at their \nappointed times. Do not say your prayers earlier for the sake of \n(available) leisure, nor should you delay them on account of any \npreoccupation. Remember that every deed of yours is dependent on your \nprayers. \nAn excerpt of the same: \nThe leader of guidance and the leader of destruction cannot be equal, nor \ncan the friend of the Prophet (h) and the enemy of the Prophet (h). The \nMessenger of Allah (h) has told me that: “With regard to my people, I \nam afraid neither of a believer nor of an unbeliever. As for the believer, \nAllah will afford him protection because of his belief. As for the \nunbeliever, Allah will humiliate him because of his lack of belief. But I \nfear for anyone of you who is hypocrite in his heart and who has mastered \nthe language. He speaks what you hold as good but does whatever you \ndislike."

    "text": "In Reply to Mu`awiyah, One of His Most Elegant Writings:\nNow, your letter has reached me wherein you recall that Allah \nchose Muhammad (h) for His religion and helped him through those \ncompanions who assisted him. Strange things about you have remained \nconcealed (by theirony of fate) from us, since you have started telling us \nof Allah’s trials for us and His bounties through [the kinship to] our \nProphet (h). In this regard, you are like one who carries dates to Hajar, \nor who challenges his own master to a duel in archery. \nYou think that so-and-so are the most distinguished persons in \nIslam. You have said such a thing with which, were it true, you have \nnothing to do, but if it is not so, then the defect in it will not affect you. \nAnd what are you going to do with the question of who is better and who \nis worse, or who is the ruler and who is the ruled? What do the freed ones \nand their sons have to do with distinguishing between the first Muhajirun \nand determining their status or defining their ranks? What a pity! The \nsound of an arrow is being produced by what is not a real arrow, and he \nagainst whom the judgement is to be passed is seated to judge! O \nmankind! Why do you not see your own lameness and thus remain within \nthe bounds, and why do you not realize the shortness of your measure and \nstay back where destiny has placed you?! You have no concern with the \ndefeat of the defeated or with the victory of the victor. \n \nYou are wandering in bewilderment, straying from the right path. \nDo you not realize it? I am not giving you any news: I am just recounting \nAllah’s bounty, namely that a number of people from among the \nMuhajirun (immigrants from Mecca) and the Ansar (helpers) fell as \nmartyrs in the way of Allah the Sublime and that each of them is \ndistinguished (on that account). But when one of us secures martyrdom, \nhe is named the chief of martyrs, and the Messenger of Allah grants him \nthe special honor of saying seventy takbir (Allahu Akbar) during his \nfuneral prayer. Do you not know that a number of people lost their hands \nin the way of Allah and that everyone is distinguished (on that account)? \nBut when the same thing takes place to one of us [such as Ja’fer al-\nTayyar], he is given the title “the flier in Paradise” and “the two-winged \none”? Had not Allah forbidden self-praise, the writer would have \nmentioned numerous distinctions which the believer knows fully well and \nwhich the ears of the listeners do not wish to forget. \n \nBetter leave those whose arrows miss themark. We [Ahl al-Bayt \n(x)] are the direct recipients of our Lord’s favors while others receive \nfavors from us after that. In spite of our established honor and well-\nknown superiority over people, we did not stay away from mingling with \nyou, intermarrying with you like equals although you are not so. And how \ncould you be so when (our status is that) among us is the Prophet (h)\nwhile among you is his opponent, among us is the lion of Allah while \namong you is the lion of the opposing groups, among us are the two \nmasters of the youths of Paradise while among you are the children of \nHell, among us is the choicest of all the women of the worlds while \namong you is the bearer of firewood, any many more distinctions on our \nside while shortcomings [abound] on yours?! \nOur Islam is well-known and our (greatness in the ) pre-Islamic \nperiod too cannot be denied. Whatever remains has been mentioned in the \nwords of Allah, the most Glorified One, the Sublime: “... blood relatives \nhave the better claim with regard to one another according to the Book of \nAllah” (Holy Quran, 33: 6). \n \nHe (Allah) the Sublime, also says the following: “Verily, of men \nthe nearest to Abraham are surely those who followed him and this \nProphet (Muhammad [h]) and those who believe, and verily, Allah, is \nthe Guardian of the faithful” (Holy Quran, 3: 68). \n \nThus, we are superior firstly because of kinship and, secondly, \nbecause of obedience [of the Almighty]. At the saqifa (of Banu Sa’idah), \nthe Muhajirun contended kinship with the Messenger of Allah against the \nAnsar, scoring over them. If that success was based on kinship, then the \nright will be ours better than yours; otherwise, the Ansar’s contention \nstands.\n \nYou think that I have been jealous of every caliph and have \nrevolted against them all. Even if this is so, it is not an offence against \nyou and, therefore, I owe you no explanation. This is a matter for which \nno blame comes to you. \n \nYou have said that I was dragged like a camel with a nose string \nto swear the oath of allegiance (to Abu Bakr). By the Eternal One (Allah), \nyou had intended to revile me, but you have instead praised me, and you \nintended to humiliate me but have your own selves been humiliated. What \nhumiliation does it mean for a Muslim to be the victim of oppression so \nlong as he does not entertain any doubt in his religion, nor any misgiving \nin his firm belief?! This argument of mine is intended for others, but I \nhave stated it to you only in so far as it is appropriate. \n \nThen you recalled my status vis-a-vis Othman. In this regard, an \nanswer is due to you because of your own kinship to him. So (now tell \nme), which of us was more inimical to Othman and who did more to bring \nabout his killing?! Who offered him his support and made him sit down, \nstopping him? Whose help was solicited but turned his face away from \nthe solicitor, drawing his[Othman’s] death near till his fate overtook him? \nNo, no; by Allah. \n \n“Indeed, Allah knows those who hinder others from among you \nand those who say to their brethren: ‘Come here to us’ and they do not go \nto fight but a little” (Holy Quran, 33: 18). \nI am not going to offer my excuse for reproaching him [Othman] \nfor (some of) his innovations, for if my good counsel and guidance to him \nwas [considered by you as] a sin, then very often a person who is blamed \nis no sinner at all, and sometimes the only reward a counselor reaps is \nsuspicion (of being an evildoer). I desired naught but reform whatever I \nam able to (reform). “My guidance is only with Allah; On Him (alone) do \nI rely and to Him (alone) do I turn” (Holy Quran, 11: 88). \n \nYou have mentioned that for me and for my followers you have \nonly the sword... This makes even a weeping person laugh. Did you ever \nsee the descendants of `Abdul-Muttalib running away from battle, or \nbeing frightened by swords?! “Wait a little till Hamal joins the battle \nshortly.”210And my sword appeased me by killing Hudhayfah. Then \nwhoever you are seeking will seek you, and whoever you think to be far \naway will approach you. I am (shortly) speeding towards you with a force \nof MuhajirÅn and Ansar and those who follow them in virtue. Their \nnumber will be great and their dust will spread all around. They will be \nwearing their shrouds, and their most coveted desire is to meet Allah. \nThey will be accompanied by the descendants of those who took part in \nthe battle of Badr. They will have Hashemite swords whose splitting you \nhave already seen in the case of your brother, maternal uncle, grandfather \nand kinsmen. “... nor are they far distant from the unjust ones” (Holy \nQuran, 11: 83). \n \nThis letter of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is in reply to Mu`awiyah’s \nletter which he sent to Kufa through Abu Umamah al-Bahili. It also \ncontains replies to some points which Mu`awiyah had raised in his letter \nsent through Abu Muslim al-Khawlani. \n \n210This line is a poetic reference to one Hamal ibn Badr. The full \ncouplet runs thus: \nWait a little bit till Hamal reaches the battlefield; \nHow pretty death is when it comes!\n \nThe story behind it is that Malik ibn Zuhayr threatened Hamal \nibn Badr with battle and in reply the latter recited this couplet then attacked \nMalik and killed him. When Malik’s brother saw this, he killed Hamal and his \nbrother Hudhayfah in revenge. Then he described this incident in the following \ncouplet: \nI appeased my heart by killing Hamal ibn Badr \nIn Ibn Abu Umamah’s letter, Mu`awiyah had mentioned the \ndeputation of the Prophet (h) and his ascension to revelation and wrote \nin such a manner as though it was a matter not known to or not \nunderstood by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and that he was in need of \nbeing informed of it. This is just like a stranger who may draw the map of \na house for the guidance of those who dwell in it and apprize them of \nthings already known to them. This is why Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nhas compared him to the man who carried dates to Hajar which was itself \nnoted for abundant growth of dates. \n \nThis is a proverb employed when someone begins to tell a person \nmatters which he already knows better. The basis of this proverb is that a \nman of Hajar, which is a town near Bahrain (in the Persian Gulf), went to \nBasra to sell goods and make purchases. Having finished the sale, he \nlooked about the market to make his purchases and found nothing cheaper \nthan dates. He, therefore, decided to purchase dates. When he reached \nHajar with his load of dates, their plentitude and cheap price there did not \nleave him any alternative but to store them so as to sell them later when \ntheir price would rise. The price, however, continued to decline day after \nday till all the dates became rotten. This left him nothing except their \nstones. In short, after making a reference to the Prophet’s ascension to \nProphethood, Mu`awiyah recounted the distinction and merits of the three \ncaliphs according to his view and wrote the following: \n \n“The most distinguished among the companions and the most \nhigh ranking in the view of the Muslims was the first caliph who gathered \nall the Muslims under one voice, removed their disunity and fought those \nwho were forsaking Islam. After him is the second caliph who won \nvictories, founded cities and humiliated the unbelievers. Then came the \nthird caliph who was the victim of oppression. He propagated religion and \nspread the word of Allah far and wide” (Siffin, al-Minqari, pp. 86-87; Al-\nIqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, pp. 334-335; Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 15, p. 186). \n \nMu`awiyah’s purpose behind bringing up this pointless warbling \nwas to injure Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s feelings and to rouse his temper \nso as to make him produce such words through his tongue or pen which \nwould so disparage the caliphs and so that he would instigate the people \nof Syria and Iraq against him by exploiting them. In fact, he had already \nset it in the minds of these people that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had \ninstigated the people against Othman, had got Talhah and az-Zubayr \nkilled, had turned Aisha out of her house and shed the blood of thousands \nof Muslims. Being unaware of the real facts, they were convinced of these \nbaseless allegations, yet to strengthen the opposition, Mu`awiyah thought \nit advisable to make them believe that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) did not \nrecognize the achievements of the three caliphs and bore enmity and \nmalice towards them to produce Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s writing as \ntestimony and to use it for rousing the people of Iraq because their \nmajority was much impressed with the environment created by the caliphs \nand with their greatness. But Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) realized his \nintention and gave him such a reply which put a knot in his tongue. So, \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) exposed the man’s lowliness by referring to \nhis enmity to Islam and to his acceptance of subjugation under force, \nadvising him to stay within his own bounds, warning him against fixing \ngrades of distinction among those Muhajirun who were in any case \nsuperior to him in so far as they had been in the vanguard of those who \nparticipated in the hijra (migration from Mecca to Medna), whereas since \nthen, Mu`awiyah himself was only one of those whose life had been \nspared (on the day when Mecca fell in the hands of the Muslims), he did \nnot have the most remote respect among the MuhajirÅn. Consequently, in \nthe matter under discussion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had put \nMu`awiyah’s status as that of a false arrow among real arrows. This is a \nproverb which is employed when a man boasts over persons among \nwhom he enjoys no regard. As regarding his statement that so-and-so is \ngreater in distinction, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has, by using the \nphrase “you think”, shown that it is his personal opinion which does not \nhave the most remote regard to the truth because this word is used when a \nfalse or an unreal statement is made. \n \nHaving refuted this claim of being the most distinguished, Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) refers to these qualities and distinctions of Banu \nHashim which conspicuously demonstrate the high degree of their \nachievements. Thus, the people who took part in jihad with the Prophet \n(h) and secured martyrdom attained high positions, but the distinction \nthat fell to Hamzah by virtue of his high performance was not secured by \nanyone else. The Prophet (h) gave him the title of “master of the \nmartyrs” and performed his funeral prayer fourteen times, thus raising the \nnumber of takbirs (Allahu Akbar) rose to seventy. Similarly, in various \nbattles, the hands of the fighters were cut off. For example, in the battle of \nBadr, the hands of Khubayb ibn Isaf al-Ansari and Mu’ath ibn Jabal, and \nin the battle of Uhud, those of `Amr ibn al-Jamuh as-Salami and `Ubayd \n(Atik) ibn at-Tayyihan (brother of Abul-Haytham at-Tayyihan) were cut \noff. But when, in the battle of Mu’tah, the hands of Ja`far ibn Abu Talib \nwere cut off, the Prophet (h) singled him out by naming him “the flier in \nParadise” and the “two-winged” resident of Paradise. \n \nHaving recounted the particular achievements of Banu Hashim, \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) refers to his own attainments with which the \nbooks of chronicles and traditions are replete and which could not be \ntarnished with doubts and misgivings. Thus, traditionists like Ahmed ibn \nHanbal(164/780 - 241/855), Ahmed ibn Ali an Nisa’i (215/830 - 303/915) \nand others say that: “The number of traditions which have been related \nthrough reliable sources with regard to the distinctions of Ali ibn AbÅ\nTalib have not been related about any other companion of the Prophet \n(h)” (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 107; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1115; Tabaqat\nal-Hanabilah, Vol. 1, p. 319; Al-Kamil, Vol. 3, p. 399; Tahthab al-\nTahthib, Vol. 7, p. 339; Fath al-Bari, Vol. 7, p. 57). \n \nAn important distinction out of these particular distinctions of \nAhl al-Bayt (x) is the one to which Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) refers in \nthese words: “We are the direct recipients of Allah’s favors while others \nreceive favors from us.” This is the height of distinction that even the \nhighest personality cannot reach its sublimity on its own, and every other \ndistinction looks small before it. Acknowledging the greatness and \nsupremacy of this sentence, Ibn Abul-Hadid writes the following: “Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) intends to convey that we [Ahl al-Bayt (x)] are not \nobligated to any person since Allah has bestowed all blessings on us \ndirectly, there being no intermediary between us and Allah, while all \nother people are under our obligation and protection, being the \nintermediary between them and Allah, the Glorified One. This is a high \nstatus indeed. Its apparent meaning is what the words show but its real \nsense is that Ahl al-Bayt (x) are the obedient servants of Allah and the \npeople must be their obedient followers” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 15, \np. 194). \n \nNow, since these people are the first recipients of the bounties of \nAllah and the source of bounties for the rest of the people, no one from \namong the people can be compared with them, nor can anyone be \nregarded as their equal on the basis of social contacts with them, much \nless than those individuals who were in direct contrast to the attainments \nand to the characteristics of these people and who used to oppose the truth \nand anything right on every occasion. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) places \nboth sides of the picture before Mu`awiyah and says the following: ‘The \nProphet (h) was one of us, while your father, Abu Sufyan, was among \nthe foremost in opposing him. Hamzah was one of us, and the Prophet \n(h) gave him the title of Lion of Allah, while your maternal grandfather, \nUtbah ibn Rabi`ah, was proud of being the lion of swearers (against the \nProphet [h])’”. \n \nWhen, in the battle of Badr, Hamzah and Utbah ibn Rabi`ah came \nto face each other, Hamzah said, “I am Hamzah son of Abdul-Muttalib; I \nam the lion of Allah and the lion of His Prophet (h)”, whereupon `Utbah \nsaid, “I am the lion of swearers (against the Prophet [h])”. In another \nversion, the word “asadul-ahlaf” is recorded. The meaning is that he was \nthe chief of the allied parties. \n \nThe story of swearing is that when Banu Abd Manaf acquired a \ndistinct status among the Arab tribes, they thought they should take over \nfrom Banu Abdid-Dar the offices relevant to the Ka`ba and to strip them \noff these offices. In this regard, Banu Abd Manaf made alliances with \nthemselves and with these tribes: Banu Asad ibn Abdil-Uzza, Banu Taym, \nBanu Zuhrah and Banu al-Harith. They concluded an agreement with all \nof them. In order to solemnize this agreement, they drenched their hands \nin teeb (perfume) and swore that they would help each other to death. For \nthis reason, these tribes were called: “tribes of sworn chaste parties”. On \nthe other side, the tribes of Banu Abdid-Dar, Banu Makhzum, Banu Sahm \nand Banu Adiy also swore that they would resist Banu Abd Manaf and \ntheir allies. These tribes are called simply the allies. `Utbah has deemed \nhimself the head of the allied parties. Some commentators have taken the \nword “sadul-ahlaf” to imply Abu Sufyan because he made different tribes \nswear against the Prophet (h) in the battle of the Trench (Khandaq), \nwhile some commentators take it to mean Asad ibn Abdil-Uzzah. But the \nlatter interpretation does not carry any weight because here Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) is addressing Mu`awiyah and this interpretation does not \nhit Mu`awiyah since Banu Abd Manaf were a party to this alliance. Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) says, “They have among themselves the masters of \nthe youths of Paradise, referring to the Prophet’s saying, al-Hassan and al-\nHussain are the masters of the youths of Paradise, while the youths of the \nother party are in Hell’. This reference is to the sons of Uqbah ibn Abu \nMu’eet to whom the Prophet (h) once said, ‘For you and your sons is \nHell’. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says that among them is the chief of all \nthe women of the worlds, namely Fatima az-Zahra (x), while in the other \nparty is the bearer of the wood, namely Umm Jamil, sister of Abu Sufyan. \nThis woman used to throw thorns in the path of the Prophet (h). She has \nbeen referred to in the Holy Quran, along with Abu Lahab, in these \nwords:\n \n“In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful \n \n“May both the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and may he perish, \ntoo. His wealth will not avail him aught nor what he earns. Soon shall he \nburn in the flaming Fire. And his wife is the bearer of the firewood. Upon \nher neck shall be a halter of twisted rope” (Holy Quran, 111: 1-5). \n \nIt is narrated from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), Umar ibn al-\nKhattab, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, Abu Sa’id al-Khudri, Abu Hurayra \nand others that the Holy Prophet (h) said the following: “Verily, Fatima \n(x) is the Supreme Lady of the women of Paradise, and al-Hassan and al-\nHussain are the two Supreme Youths of Paradise. But their father (Ali) is \nSuperior to them” (Al-Jamias-Sahih, al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, pp. 656, 661; \nAl-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 3, pp. 3, 62, 64, 82; Vol. 5, pp. 391, \n392; Al-Sunan, Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, p. 56; Al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, Vol. 3, \np. 167; Majma’az-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, pp. 183, 184, 201; Kanz al-Ummal, al-\nMuttaqi, Vol. 13, pp. 127, 128; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, p. 1895; Usd al-Ghaba, \nVol. 5, p. 574; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 1, p. 140; Vol. 6, p. 372; Vol. 10, p. \n230; Tarikh, Ibn Asakir, Vol. 7, p. 365). \n \nIt is also narrated from Imran ibn al-Hussain and Abu Tha’labah \nal-Khushni that the Holy Prophet (h) said the following to Fatima (x):\n“O my daughter! Are you not satisfied that you are verily the Supreme \nLady of all women of the worlds?” She said, “O father! Then what about \nMaryam (Mary) daughter of Imran?” He said, “She was the Supreme \nLady of her time while you are the Supreme Lady of all ages. Truly, by \nAllah, I married you off to one who is a master in this world and in the \nhereafter. No one hates him save a hypocrite” (Hilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 2, \np. 92; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, p. 1895; Al-Isaba, Vol. 4, p. 275). \n \nAlso, Aisha narrated that the Holy Prophet (h) said the \nfollowing: “O Fatima (x)! Will you not be satisfied to be the Supreme \nLady of the women of the worlds (or) the Supreme Lady of all women of \nthis umma (community) or of the women believers?” (al-Bukhari, Sahih, \nVol. 8, p. 79; Muslim, Sahih, Vol. 7, pp. 142-144; Ibn Majah, Al-Sunan, \nVol. 1, p. 518; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Al-Musnad, Vol. 6, p. 282; al-Hakim, \nAl-Mustadrak Ala Sahihayn, Vol. 3, p. 156). \nThe person who goes too far in counselling others will be thought \nto have his personal ends in so doing, even though his counsel may well \nbe based on sincerity of intention and selflessness. A poetic couplet runs \nas follows:\nHow often a good counsel did I offer you, but sometimes \nThe only reward a counsellor reaps is suspicion."

    "text": "To Mu`awiyah\n \nFear Allah regarding what you have amassed and find out your \ntrue right turn to understand, for you will not be excused on the grounds \nof ignorance. Certainly, for (following the path of) obedience there are \nclear signs, shining ways, straight highways and a fixed aim. The shrewd \nproceed towards them while the mean ones turn away from them. \nWhoever turns his face from them deviates from righteousness and gropes \nin bewilderment. Allah takes away His bounty from him and afflicts him \nwith His chastisement. Therefore, beware of your own selves. Allah has \nalready shown you your way and the end where your affairs will \nterminate. You are speeding towards the aim of loss and the status of \nunbelief. Your ego has pushed you towards evil, thrown you into \nmisguidance and conveyed you to destruction, placing obstacles in your \nway. \nCommandment 31 \nHe Wrote it for His Son al-Hassan ibn Ali (x)1 When He \nCamped at Al-hadirin on His Way Back from Siffin: \nFrom the father who is (shortly) to die, who acknowledges the \nhardships of times, who has turned away from life, who has submitted \nhimself to the (calamities of) time, who realizes the evils of the world, \nwho is living in the abodes of the dead and is due to depart from them any \nday... to the son who yearns for what is not to be achieved, who is \ntreading the path of those who have died, who is the victim of ailments, \nwho is entangled in the (worries of the ) days, who is a target of \nhardships, a slave of the world, a trader of its deception, a debtor of \nwishes, a prisoner of morality, an ally of worries, a neighbor of griefs, a \nvictim of distresses who has been overpowered by desires and a successor \nof the dead. \n \nNow (you should know that) what I have learned from the turning \naway of this world from me, the onslaught of time over me and the \nadvancing of the next world towards me is enough to prevent me from \nremembering anyone except my soul and from thinking beyond myself. \nBut when I confined myself to my own worries, leaving aside the worries \nof others, my intelligence saved me and protected me from my own \ndesires. It clarified to me my affairs and led me to seriousness wherein \nthere was no trickery and truth which was not tarnished by falsehood. \nHere, I found you a part of myself, rather I found you my whole, so much \nso that if anything befell you, it was as though it befell me, and if death \ncame to you, it was as though it came to me. Consequently, your affairs \nmeant to me what my own matters meant to me. So, I have written this \npiece of advice (to you) as an instrument of seeking help, whether I \nremain alive or cease to exist. \nI admonish you to fear Allah, O my child, to abide by His \ncommands, to fill your heart with His remembrance and to cling to hope \nfrom Him. No regard is more reliable than the regard between you and \nAllah provided you take hold of it. Enliven your heart with preaching, kill \nit by renunciation, energize it with firm belief, enlighten it with wisdom, \nhumiliate it by recalling death, make it believe in mortality, make it see \nthe misfortunes of this world, make it fear the authority of the time and \nthe severity of some changes during the nights and the days. Place before \nit the events of past peoples, recall to it what befell those who were before \nyou and walk among their cities and ruins, then see what they did and \nfrom what they have gone away, where they have gone and stayed. You \nwill find that they departed from (their) friends and remained in \nloneliness. Shortly, you, too, will be like one of them. Therefore, plan for \nyour place of stay and do not sell your next life for this one. \n \nGive up discussing what you do not know and speaking about \nwhat does not concern you. Keep off the track from which you fear to go \nastray because refraining (from moving) when there is fear of straying is \nbetter than embarking on dangers. Ask others to do good; you will thus be \namong the doers of goodness. Discourage others from evil deeds with \nyour own actions as well as speech and keep off, to the best of your \nability, from whoever commits it. Struggle for Allah as is His due, and the \nreviling of a reviler should not deter you in matters relevant to Allah. \nLeap into dangers for the sake of what is right wherever it may be. \nAcquire insight into religious law. Habituate yourself to endure hardships \nsince the best trait of character is endurance in matters of righteousness. \nIn all your affairs, resign yourself to your Lord because you will thus be \nresigning yourself to a secure shelter and a strong protector. You should \nask only from your Lord because in His hand is all the giving and \ndepriving. Seek goodness (from Allah) as much as you can. Understand \nmy advice and do not turn away from it because the best saying is that \nwhich benefits. Be informed that there is no good in that knowledge \nwhich is futile, and if knowledge is not implemented, then its acquisition \nis not justified. \n \nO my child! When I noticed that I was of goodly age and noticed \nthat I was increasing in weakness, I hastened with regard to my will to \nyou and wrote down salient points lest death should overtook me before I \ndivulged to you what I have in my heart, or lest my wit should be affected \njust as my body has been, or the forces of passions or the mischiefs of the \nworld overtake you making you like a stubborn camel. Certainly, the \nheart of a young man is like an uncultivated land. It accepts whatever is \nstrewn on it. So, I hastened to mold you properly before your heart \nhardened and your mind became occupied, so that you might be ready to \naccept through your intelligence the results of the experience of others \nand be saved from going through these experiences yourself. In this way, \nyou will avoid the hardship of seeking them and the difficulties of \nexperimenting. Thus, you are getting to know what we had experienced \nand even those things are becoming clear to you which we might have \nmissed. \n \nO my child! Even though I have not reached the age which those \nbefore me have, yet I looked into their behavior and thought over events \nof their lives. I walked among their ruins till I was like one of them. In \nfact, by virtue of their affairs that have become known to me, it is as \nthough I have lived with them from the very first to the very last. I have, \ntherefore, been able to discern the impure from the clean and benefit from \nharm. \n \nI have selected for you the choicest of those matters and collected \nfor you their good points and have kept away from you their useless \npoints. Since I feel for your affairs as a living father should, I aim at \ngiving you guidance. I thought it should be at a time when you are \nadvancing in age and new to the state of the world, possessing upright \nintention and a clean heart and that I should, being with the teaching of \nthe Book of Allah, to Whom belong Might and Majesty, and its \ninterpretation, the laws and commandments of Islam, its lawful matters \nand unlawful ones and that I should not go beyond these for you. Then I \nfeared lest you should get confused as other people had been confused on \naccount of their passions and (different) views. Therefore, in spite of \ndisliking the thought of warning you, I thought it better for me to make \nthis issue strong rather than leave you in a status where I do not regard \nyou safe from falling into destruction. I hoped that Allah will help you in \nyour straightforwardness and guide you in your resoluteness. \nConsequently, I wrote this piece of my will for you. \n \nBe informed, O my child, that what I love the most for you is that \nyou adopt my will to fear Allah, to confine yourself to what Allah has \nmade obligatory on you, to follow the actions of your forefathers and the \nvirtuous people of your household. These did not fall short in seeing for \nthemselves what you will see for yourself, and they did about their affairs \nas you will like to think (about your own affairs). Thereafter, their \nthinking led them to discharge the obligations which they came to know \nand to desist from what they were not required to do. If your heart does \nnot accept this without acquiring knowledge as they acquired it, then your \nsearch should first be by way of understanding and learning, not by \nfalling into doubts or getting entangled in quarrels. \nBefore you probe into this, you should begin by seeking your \nLord’s help, turning to Him for competence and keeping aloof from \neverything that throws you into doubt or flings you towards misguidance. \nWhen you have made sure that your heart is clean and humble and your \nthoughts have come together, and once you have only a reflection about \nthis matter..., it is then that you will see what I have explained to you. If \nyou have not been able to achieve that peace of observation and thinking \nwhich you will like to have, then be informed that you are only stamping \nthe ground like a blind she-camel and falling into darkness while a seeker \nof religion should not grope in the dark, nor should he create confusion. It \nis better to avoid this. \n \nAppreciate my advice, O my child, and be admonished that \nWhoever is the master of death is also the master of life, that the Creator \ncauses death as well as gives life, that Whoever destroys is also the \nrestorer of life, and that Whoever inflicts disease is also the one Who \ncures. This world continues in the way which Allah has made it with \nregard to its pleasures, trials, rewards on the Day of Judgement and all \nthat He wishes and you do not know. If anything of this advice is not \nunderstood by you then attribute it to your ignorance of it because when \nyou were first born, you were born ignorant. Thereafter, you acquired \nknowledge. There are many masters of whom you are ignorant. There are \nmany issues regarding which your sight first wonders and your eye \nwonders then, after this, you shall see them as they are. Therefore, cling \nto the One Who created you, Who fed you and put you in order. Your \nworship should be for Him, your eagerness should be towards Him and \nyour fear should be of Him. \n \nBe informed, O my child, that no one received messages from \nAllah, the Glorified One, as the Prophet (h) did. Therefore, regard him \nas your guide and leader towards salvation. Certainly, I shall spare no \neffort in giving you advice, and surely even if you try, you cannot acquire \nsuch insight for your welfare as I have for you. \n \nBe informed, O my child, that if there had been a partner with \nyour Lord, his [alleged partner’s] messengers, too, should have come to \nyou and you would have seen signs of his authority and power; you \nshould have known his deeds and qualities. But He is only One god, \nAllah, and He has described Himself. No one can dispute with Him \nregarding His authority. He is from eternity and will remain for eternity. \nHe is before all things without any beginning. He will remain after all \nthings without an end. He is far too great to have His divinity proved by \nany encompassing heart or by any vision. Once you have understood this, \nyou should do what is done by him who is like you by way of his low \nstatus, his lack of authority, his increasing incapability and his great need \nfor his Lord so as to seek His obedience. Fear His chastisement and be \nforewarned of His wrath because He does not command you save to be \nvirtuous; He does not refrain you save from evil. \n \nO my child! I have informed you about the world, its condition, \nits decay and its passing away, and I have informed you of the next world \nand of what has been provided in it for its people. I have recounted to you \nparables about it so that you may draw instruction from them and depend \nupon them. The example of those who have understood the world is like \nthose travelers who, being fed-up with drought-stricken places, set off for \ngreenery and a fruitful place. Then they endure difficulties on the way, \nseparation from friends, hardships of the journey and unwholesome food \nin order to reach their fields of plenty and places of stay. Consequently, \nthey do not feel any pain in all this and do not regard any expenditure to \nbe a waste. Nothing is more lovable to them than what takes them near \ntheir goal and carries them closer to their place of stay. (Contrariwise), the \nexample of those who are deceived by this world is like the people who \nwere in a green place but became disgruntled with it and went to a \ndrought-stricken place. Therefore, for them nothing is more detestable or \nabominable than to leave the place where they were and go to a place \nwhich they will reach unexpectedly and for which they were heading. \n \nO my child! Make yourself the measure (for dealings) between \nyou and others. Thus, you should wish for others what you wish for \nyourself and hate for others what you hate for yourself. Do not oppress as \nyou do not like to be oppressed. Do good to others as you like good to be \ndone to you. Regard as bad for yourself whatever you regard as bad for \nothers. Accept that from others which you like others to accept from you. \nDo not talk about what you do not know even though what you know may \nbe very little. Do not say to others what you do not like to be said to you. \n \nBe informed that self-admiration is contrary to propriety (of \naction) and is a calamity for the mind. Therefore, increase your striving \nand do not become a treasurer for (wealth to be inherited by) others. \nWhen you have been guided on the right path, humble yourself before \nAllah as much as you can. \n \nBe informed that in front of you lies a road of long distance and \nsevere hardship and that you cannot avoid treading it. Take your \nrequirements of provision keeping the burden light. Do not load your back \nbeyond your ability lest its weight should cause you mischief. Whenever \nyou come across a needy person who can carry for you your provision to \nhand it back to you on the Day of Judgement when you will need it, \naccept it as a good opportunity and get him to carry it. Put in that \nprovision as much as you are able to, for it is likely that if you need him \n(afterwards), you may not get hold of him. If a person is willing to borrow \nfrom you in the days of your affluence to pay it back to you at the time of \nyour need, then make use of this opportunity. \n \nBe informed that in front of you lies an impassable valley \nwherein the light-burdened man will be in a better condition than the \nheavy-burdened one and the slow-paced will be in a worse condition than \nthe swift-paced. Your terminating point at the other end of this passage \nwill necessarily be either Paradise or Hell. Therefore, reconnoiter for \nyourself before alighting and prepare the place before getting down \nbecause after death there can be no preparation nor any return to this \nworld.\n \nBe informed that Whoever owns the treasuries of the heavens and \nearth has permitted you to pray to Him and has promised you acceptance \nof the prayer. He has commanded you to beg from Him in order that He \nmay give you and to seek His mercy in order that He may have mercy on \nyou. He has not placed anything between you and Him that may veil Him \nfrom you. \n \nHe has not required you to get a mediator between yourself and \nHim, and if you err, He has not prevented you from repenting. He does \nnot hasten His punishment. He does not reprimand you for repenting, nor \ndoes He humiliate you when humiliation is more appropriate for you. He \nis not harsh in accepting repentance. He does not severely question you \nabout your sins. He does not disappoint you regarding His mercy. Rather, \nHe regards abstention from sin as a virtue. He counts your sin as one \nwhile counting your good deed as ten. \n \nHe has opened for you the door of repentance. Therefore, \nwhenever you call upon Him, He hears your call, and whenever you \nwhisper to Him, He knows the whispers. Place before Him your needs, \nunveil yourself before Him, complain to Him of your worries, beseech \nHim to remove your troubles, seek His help in your affairs and ask Him to \ngrant you from the treasuries of His mercy that which no one else has \npower to give, namely length of life, health of body and an increase in \nyour sustenance. Then He has placed the keys of His treasures in your \nhands in the sense that He has shown you the way to ask Him. \nWherever you wish, He opens the doors of His favor by virtue of \nyour prayers. Let the abundant rains of His mercy fall on you. Delay in \nacceptance of your pleas should not disappoint you because the granting \nof a plea is dependent on the extent of (your) intention. Sometimes, \nacceptance (of a plea) is delayed with a view to its being a source of \ngreater reward to the pleading one and a better gift to the anticipating \nperson. Sometimes, you may ask for a thing but it is not given to you and \na better thing is given to you later, or a thing is taken away from you for \nsome greater good because sometimes you may ask for a thing which \ncontains ruin for your religion if it is granted to you. Therefore, your \nrequest should be for things the beauty of which should be lasting and the \nburden of which should remain away from you. As for wealth, it will not \nlast for you, nor will you live for its sake. \n \nO my child! Be informed that you have been created for the next \nworld, not for this one, for extinction (in this world), not for lasting, and \nfor dying, not for living. You are in a place which does not belong to you, \nan abode for making preparations and a passage towards the next world. \nYou are being chased by death from which the runner-away cannot \nescape, as it will surely overtake him. So, be on guard against it least it \nshould overtake you at a time when you are in a sinful state and you are \nthinking of repenting, but it creates obstruction between you and between \nrepenting. In such a case, you will ruin yourself. \n \nO my child! Remember death quite often and the place where you \nhave to go suddenly and reach after death, so that when it comes, you will \nbe already on your guard against it, having prepared yourself for it, and it \ndoes not come to you all of a sudden and surprise you. Beware lest you \nshould become deceived by the leanings of the people towards worldly \nattractions and their rushing upon it. Allah has warned you about it and \nthe world has informed you of its mortal character, unveiling to you its \nevils.\n \nSurely, those (who go) after it are like barking dogs or devouring \ncarnivore who hate each other. Those who are stronger among them eat \naway the weaker ones, and the big among them tramples over the small. \nSome are like tied cattle, and some are like untied cattle that have lost \ntheir wits and are running in unknown directions. They are flocks of \ncalamities wandering in rugged valleys. There is no herdsman to detain \nthem nor anyone to tend to them and take them to graze. The world has \nput them on the track of blindness and taken away their vision from the \nbeacons of guidance. They have, therefore, been perplexed in its \nbewilderment and sunk in its pleasures. They took it as a god, so it played \nhavoc with them. They, too, played with it and forgot what is beyond it. \n \nDarkness disappears gradually. Now it is as though travellers \nhave got down and those who hasten will soon meet. Be informed, O my \nchild, that everyone who is riding on the carriage of night and day is \nbeing carried by them even though he may be stationary; he is covering \nthe distance even though he is staying and resting. \n \nKnow with certainty that you cannot achieve your desire and \nexceed your destined life. You are on the track of those before you. \nTherefore, be humble in seeking and moderate in earning because often \nseeking leads to deprivation. Every seeker of livelihood does not get it [on \nhis own], nor is everyone who is moderate in seeking is deprived. Keep \nyourself away from every low thing even though it may take you to your \ndesired aims because you will not get any return for your own respect \nwhich you exhaust. Do not be the slave of others for Allah had made you \nfree. There is no goodness in anything “good” achieved through evil, and \nthere is no good in comfort that is achieved through a (disgracing) effort. \n \nBeware lest bearers of greed should carry you and make you \ndescend down to the springs of destruction. If you can, manage that there \nwill be no wealthy person between yourself and Allah. Do so because in \nany case you will find what is for you and get what is your share. A little \nreceived directly from Allah the Glorified One is more dignified than that \nwhich is more but is received through His creatures, although (really) all \nis from Allah. \n \nIt is easier to rectify what you miss by silence than to secure what \nyou lose by speaking. Whatever is in a pot can be retained by closing the \nlid. I should prefer you retain what is in your hands rather than seeking \nwhat is in the hands of others. The bitterness of disappointment is better \nthan seeking a hand-out from people. Manual labor with chastity is better \nthan the riches of a vicious life. A man is the best guard of his own \nsecrets. Often, a man strives for what harms him. Whoever speaks much \nspeaks nonsense. Whoever ponders perceives. Associate yourself with the \npeople of virtue, you will become one of them. Keep aloof from people of \nvic, you will remain safe from them. The worst food is that which is \nunlawful. Oppressing the weak is the worst type of oppression. \n \nWhere leniency is unsuitable, harshness is lenience. Often, cure is \nillness and illness is cure. Often, the ill-wisher gives correct advice while \nthe well-wisher cheats. Do not depend upon hopes because hopes are the \nmainstay of fools. It is wise to safeguard one’s experience. Your best \nexperience is that which teaches you a lesson. Make use of leisure before \nit changes into grief. Every seeker does not achieve (what he seeks), and \neveryone who departs never returns. To lose provision and to earn evil \nfor the Day of Judgement means ruin. Every matter has a consequence. \nWhat is destined for you will shortly come to you. A trader undertakes a \nrisk. Often a small quantity is more beneficial than a large one. There is \nno good in an ignoble helper nor in a suspicious friend. Be compliant with \nthe world as long as it is in your grip. Do not put yourself to risk \nregarding anything in expectation for more. Beware lest the attitude of \nenmity should overpower you. \n \nBear yourself towards your brother in such a way that if he \ndisregards kinship, you maintain it; when he turns away, be kind to him \nand draw near to him; when he withholds, spend over him; when he \ndistances himself, approach him; when he is harsh to you, be lenient to \nhim; when he commits a wrong deed, think of an excuse for him as \nthough you were a slave of his. Take care that this should not be done \ninappropriately and that you should not behave thus with an undeserving \nperson. Do not take the enemy of your friend as a friend of yours because \nyou will thus antagonize your friend. Give true advice to your brother, be \nit sweet or bitter. Swallow your anger because I did not find a sweeter \nthing than its taste in the end, and nothing is more pleasant than it in the \nend. Be lenient to him who is harsh to you, for it is likely that he will \nshortly become lenient to you. Treat your enemy with favors because this \nis the sweeter of the two successes (the success of revenge and the \nsuccess of doing a favor). \n \nIf you intend to cut yourself off from a friend, leave some room \nfor him from your side by which he may resume his friendship if it so \noccurs to him some day. If anyone has a good idea about you, prove it to \nbe true. Do not disregard the interests of your brother depending upon \nyour terms with him, for he is not your brother if you disregard his \ninterests. Your family should not become the most miserable people on \nyour account. Do not lean towards him who turns away from you. Your \nbrother should not be more firm in his disregard for kinship than you in \npaying regard to it and you should exceed in doing good to him than his \ndoing evil to you. Do not feel too much the oppression of a person who \noppresses you because he is only busy in harming himself and benefitting \nyou. The reward of him who pleases you is not that you should displease \nhim. \nBe informed, O my child, that livelihood is of two kinds: a \nlivelihood that you seek and a livelihood that seeks you which is such that \nif you do not reach it, it will reach you. How bad it is to bend down at the \ntime of need and to be harsh while being in riches! You should have from \nthis world only that with which you can adorn your permanent abode. If \nyou cry over what has gone out of your hands, then also cry for what has \nnot at all come to you. Infer about what has not yet happened from what \nhas already happened because occurrences are ever similar. Do not be like \nthose whom preaching does not benefit unless you inflict pain on them \nbecause the wise take instruction from teaching while beasts learn only \nfrom beating. \n \nWard off from yourself the onslaught of worries by firmness of \nendurance and purity of belief. Whoever gives up moderation commits \nexcesses. A companion is like a relationship. A friend is one whose \nabsence also proves his friendship. Passion is a partner of distress. Often, \nthe near ones are more remote than the distant ones, and often the distant \nones are nearer than the near ones. A stranger is one who has no friends. \nWhoever transgresses right narrows his own passage. Whoever stays in \nhis status remains constant upon it. The most trustworthy intermediary is \nthat which you adopt between yourself and Allah the Glorified One. \nWhoever does not care for your interests is your enemy. When greed \nleads to ruin deprivation is an achievement. Not every defect can be \nreviewed and not every opportunity recurs. \n \nOften, a person with eyes misses the track while a blind person \nfinds the correct path. Delay an evil deed because you will be able to \nhasten it whenever you wish. The disregard of kinship of the ignorant is \nequal to regarding the kinship of the wise. Whoever takes the world to be \nsafe, it will betray him. Whoever regards the world as great, it will \nhumiliate him. Not everyone who shoots hits. When authority changes, \nthe time changes, too. Consult the friend before taking a course, the \nneighbor before buying the house. Beware lest you should mention in \nyour speech what may cause laughter even though you may be relating it \nfrom others. \n \nDo not consult women because their view is weak and their \ndetermination is unstable. Cover their eyes by keeping them under the veil \nbecause strictness of veiling keeps them for long. Their coming out is not \nworse than your allowing an untrustworthy man to visit them. If you can \nmanage that they should not know anyone other than you, do so. Do not \nallow a woman matters other than those about herself because a woman is \na flower not an administrator. Do not pay her regard beyond herself. Do \nnot encourage her to intercede for others. Do not show suspicion out of \nplace because this leads a woman on the right course to evil and a chaste \nwoman to deflection. \n \nFor everyone among your servants fix a task for which you may \nhold him responsible. In this way, they will not fling the task one over the \nother. Respect your kinsmen because they are your wings with which you \nfly, the origin towards which you return and the hands with which you \nattack. Place your religion and your world at Allah’s disposal and beg \nHim to ordain the best for you with regard to thenear and the far, this \nworld and the next, and that is the end of the matter."

You should be on guard against him \nbecause he is the Satan who approaches a believer from the front and \nfrom the back, from the right and from the left, to catch him suddenly in \nthe hour of his carelessness and to overcome his intelligence. \nDuring the days of `Umar ibn al-Khattab, Abu Sufyan happened \nto utter a thoughtless point which was an evil insinuation of Satan from \nwhich neither kinship is established nor entitlement to succession occurs. \nWhoever relies on it is like the uninvited guest to a drinking party or like \nthe dangling cup (tied to a saddle). \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “When Ziyad read the letter, \nhe said, ‘By Allah he has testified to it’. This point remained in his mind \ntill Mu`awiyah claimed him (to be his brother from his father’s side).” \nArdashir Khurrah (Persia) \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s word “al-waghil” means the man who \njoins the drinking group so as to drink with them, but he is not one of \nthem. He is, therefore, constantly turned out and pushed away. As for the \nwords “an-nawtul-mudhabdhab”, it is a wooden cup or a bowl, or the like, \nattached to the saddle of the rider so that it dangles when the rider drives \nthe beast or it hastens its pace. \n \nUmar ibn al-Khattab sent Ziyad to Yemen for some encounter. \nWhen he returned, having finished his mission, he addressed a gathering \nwhich included Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), Umar, Amr ibn al-As and \nAbu Sufyan. Impressed with the speech, Amr ibn al-As said the \nfollowing: “What a good man! Had he been from the tribesmen of \nQuraish, he would have led all of Arabia with his stick,” whereupon Abu \nSufyan said, “He is from the tribesmen of Quraish since I know who his \nfather is.” Amr ibn al-As inquired, “Who was his father?” Abu Sufyan \nsaid, “It is I.” History also conclusively holds that Ziyad’s mother, \nSumayya, who was a slave-maid of al-Harith ibn Kaldah and was married \nto a slave named Ubayd, used to lead an immoral life in a quarter of at-\nTa’if known as Haratul-Baghaya (quarter of the prostitutes) and immoral \nmen used to visit her. Once Abu Sufyan also slept with her through the \nmediation of Abu Maryam as-Saluli. As a result, Ziyad was born. When \nAmr ibn al-As heard this from Abu Sufyan, he asked why he had not \ndeclared it publicly. Abu Sufyan pointed to `Umar [ibn al-Khattab] and \nsaid that he was afraid of him; otherwise, he would have declared him as \nhis own son. Although he would not have dared to do this, when \nMu`awiyah acquired power, he started correspondence with him because \nMu`awiyah was in need of such persons who were intelligent and cunning \nand expert in scheming. In any case, when Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\ngot information about this correspondence, he wrote this letter to Ziyad \nwherein he warned him against Mu`awiyah so that he should not fall in \nthe trap. But he did fall in his trap anyway and joined Mu`awiyah; the \nlatter declared him as his brother by attributing him to his kinsfolk \nalthough the Prophet (h) had declared, “The child goes to the lawful \nhusband while the adulterer gets stoned.”"

Fadak or no Fadak, tomorrow this body is to go into the grave in the \ndarkness of which it will be destroyed and (even) news of it will \ndisappear. It is a pit that, even if its width is widened or the hands of the \ndigger make it broad and open, the stones and clods of clay will narrow it \nand the falling earth will close its opening. I try to keep myself engaged in \npiety so that on the Day of Great Fear it will be peaceful and steady in \nslippery places. \n \nHad I wished, I could have taken the way leading to (worldly \npleasures like) pure honey, fine wheat and silk clothes, but it cannot be \nthat my passions lead me and greed takes me to choosing good meals \nwhile in the Hijaz or in Yamama there may be people who have no hope \nof getting bread or who do not have a full meal. Shall I lie down with a \nsatiated belly while around me there may be hungry bellies and thirsty \nlivers? Or shall I be as the poet has said: \nIt is enough for you to have a disease that you lie with your belly \nfull While around you people may be badly yearning for dried leather...? \n \nShall I be content with being called Amr al-Mu’minin \n(Commander of the Faithful), although I do not share with the people the \nhardships of the world? Or shall I be an example for them in the distresses \nof life? I have not been created to keep myself busy eating good foods \nlike a tied animal whose only worry is his fodder or like a loose animal \nwhose activity is to swallow. It fills its belly with its feed and forgets the \npurpose behind it. Shall I be left uncontrolled to pasture freely, or draw \nthe rope of misguidance or roam aimlessly in the paths of bewilderment? \n \nI see as if one of you will say that if this is what the son of Abu \nTalib eats, then weakness must have made him unfit to fight his foes and \nencounter the brave ones. Remember that the tree of the forest is the best \ntimber, while green twigs have soft bark and the wild bushes are very \nstrong for burning and slow in dying. My relationship with the Messenger \nof Allah is that of one branch with another, or like the wrist with the \nforearm. By Allah, if the Arabs join together to fight me, I will not run \naway from them, and if I get the opportunity, I will hasten to catch them \nby their necks. I shall surely strive to relieve the earth of this man of \nperverse mind and uncouth body till the bits of earth are removed from \nthe grain. \nAn excerpt from the same which is the end of the letter: \nGet away from me, O world! Your rein is on your own shoulders \nas I have released myself from your clutches, removed myself from your \nsnares and avoided walking into your slippery places. Where are those \nwhom you have deceived by your jokes? Where are those communities \nwhom you have enticed with your embellishments? They are all confined \nto graves and hidden in burial places. By Allah, if you had been a visible \npersonality and a body capable of feeling, I will have awarded you the \npenalties fixed by Allah because of the people whom you received \nthrough desires, the communities whom you threw into destruction and \nthe rulers whom you consigned to ruin and drove to places of distress \nafter which there is neither going nor returning. Indeed, whoever stepped \non your slippery place slipped, whoever rode your waves was drowned, \nand whoever evaded your snares received inward support. Whoever keeps \nhimself safe from you does not worry even though his affairs may be \nstraitened and the world to him is like a day which is near to expire. \n \nGet away from me for, by Allah, I do not bow before you so that \nyou may humiliate me, nor do I let loose the reins for you so that you may \ndrive me away! I swear by Allah an oath wherein I, except if Allah wills \notherwise, shall so train myself that it will feel joyed if it gets one loaf to \neat and be content with only salt to season it. I shall let my eyes empty \nthemselves of tears like the stream whose water has flown away. Should \nAli eat whatever he has and fall asleep like the cattle who fill their \nstomachs from the pasture land then lie down, or as the grazing goats, eat \nthe green grass then go into their pen! His eyes may die if he, after long \nyears, follows the ways of loose cattle and pasturing animals. \n \nBlessed is whoever carries out his obligations towards Allah and \nendures his hardships, allows himself no sleep in the night but when sleep \noverpowers him, he lies down on the ground using his hand as a pillow, \nalong with those who keep their eyes wakeful in fear of the Day of \nJudgement, whose bodies are ever away from beds, whose lips are \nhumming in remembrance of Allah and whose sins have been erased \nthrough their prolonged beseeching for forgiveness. They are the party of \nAllah; Be it known, “... verily the part of Allah alone shall be the \nsuccessful one” (Holy Quran, 58: 22). Therefore, O Ibn Hunayf, fear \nAllah and be content with your own loaves so that you may escape Hell. \n \nFadak was a green fertile village near Medina in the Hijaz region, \nand it also had a fortress called ash-Shumrukh (Mu’jam al-Buldan, Vol. 4, \np. 238; Mu’jam Masta’jam, al-Bakri, Vol. 3, p. 1015; Al-Rawd al-Mi’tar, \nal-Himyari, p. 437; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. 4, p. 1280). Fadak belonged to \nthe Jews. In the year 7 A.H., its ownership went from the Jews to the \nProphet (h) under the terms of a peace settlement. The reason for this \nsettlement was that after the fall of Khaybar, the Jews realized the real \npower of the Muslims, their martial aspirations were lowered. Noting that \nthe Prophet (h) had spared the lives of some Jews who sought his \nprotection, the Jews also sent a message of peace to the Prophet (h) and \nexpressed their desire that Fadak should be taken from them so that their \narea should not be turned into a battlefield. Consequently, the Prophet \n(h) accepted their request and granted them amnesty. This land became \nhis personal property wherein no one else had any right or claim, nor \ncould there be any interest because the Muslims had a share only in those \nproperties which they acquired as booty after jihad, whereas property \nacquired without jihad is called fay’ and only the Prophet (h) was \nentitled to it. No other person has a share in it. Thus, Allah says the \nfollowing: “And whatever Allah bestows on His Messenger from them, \nyou did not stir any horse or a camel towards it, but Allah grants authority \nto whomsoever of His Messengers He pleases; and Allah over all things is \nall-Powerful” (Holy Quran, 59: 6). \n \nNo one has ever disputed the fact that Fadak was secured without \nbattle. It was, therefore, the Prophet’s personal property to which no one \nelse was entitled. The Historians write:. \n“Fadak was personal to the Prophet (h) as the Muslims did not \nuse their horses or camels to acquire it” (Tarikh, al-Tabari, Vol. 1, pp. \n1582-583, 1589; Al-Kamil, Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 2, pp. 224-225; As-Sira, Ibn \nHisham, Vol. 3, p. 368; Tarikh, Ibn Khaldun, Vol. 2, part 2, p. 40; Tarikh \nal-Khamis, ad-Diyar-Bakri, Vol. 2, p. 58; Al-Sira al-Halabiyya, Vol. 3, p. \n50).\n \nThe historian and geographical scholar, Ahmed ibn Yahya al-\nBaladhiri (d. 279/892), writes the following: “Fadak was the personal \nproperty of the Prophet (h) as the Muslims had not used their horses nor \ncamels for its acquisition” (Fath al-Buldan, Vol. 1, p. 33). \n \nUmar ibn al-Khattab had himself regarded Fadak as the unshared \nproperty of the Holy Prophet (h) when he declared the following: “The \nproperty of Banu an-Nadir was among that which Allah bestowed on His \nMessenger. Against them [its original Jewish owners], neither horses nor \ncamels were stirred. It belonged to the Messenger of Allah specifically” \n(Sahih, al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, p. 46; Vol. 7, p. 82; Vol. 9, pp. 121-122 Sahih, \nMuslim, Vol. 5, p. 151; Al-Sunan, Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, pp. 139-141; Al-\nSunan, al-Nisa’i, Vol. 7, p. 132; Al-Musnad, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, \npp. 25, 48, 60, 208; Al-Sunan al-Kubra, al-Bayhayqi, Vol. 6, pp. 296-\n299).\n \nIt is also proven, in the accepted way, that the Prophet (h) had in \nhis lifetime given this land (Fadak) to Fatima (x) as a gift. It is narrated \nthrough al-Bazzar, Abu Ya`li, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn Mardawayh and others \nfrom Abu Sa’id al-Khudri and through Ibn Mardawayh from Abdullah ibn \nAbbas that when the verse: “And give to the near of kin his due...” (Holy \nQuran, 17: 26) was revealed, the Holy Prophet (h) called Fatima (x) and \ngave her Fadak as a gift” (Al-Durr al-Manthur, al-Sayyuti, vol, 4, p. 177; \nMajma’ al-Zawa’id, al-Haythami, vol, 7, p. 46; Kanz al-Ummal, al-\nMuttaqi al-Hindi, Vol. 3, p. 439; Ruh al-Ma’ani, al-Alusi, Vol. 15, p. 62). \n \nWhen Abu Bakr assumed power then, in view of reaping some \nbenefits for his government, he turned Fatima (x) out of Fadak and took it \nfrom her possession. Thus, the historians write: “Certainly, Abu Bakr \nsnatched Fadak from Fatima (x) (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Ibn Abul-Hadid, \nVol. 16, p. 219; Wafa’ul-Wafa’, as-Samhudi, Vol. 3, p. 1000; Al-Sawa’iq \nal-Muhriqa, Ibn Hajar, p. 32). \nFatima (x) raised her objection against such an injustice. \nProtesting to Abu Bakr, she said, “You have taken over the possession of \nFadak although the Prophet (h) had given it to me as a gift during his \nlifetime.” To this, Abu Bakr asked her to produce a witness for the gift. \nConsequently, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and Umm Ayman testified in \nher favor. Umm Ayman was the freed bondmaid and the dry nurse of the \nHoly Prophet (h). She was the mother of Usamah ibn Zayd ibn al-\nHarithah. The Holy Prophet (h) used to say, “Umm Ayman is my mother \nafter my own mother” [Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 4, p. 63; al-Tabari, Vol. 3, p. \n3460; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, p. 1793; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 5, p. 567. The Holy \nProphet (h) testified that she is among the people of Paradise (Ibn Sa`d, \nVol. 8, p. 192; Al-Isaba, Vol. 4, p. 432). But this testimony was held \ninadmissible by Abu Bakr, and Fatima’s claim was rejected as being \nbased on a false statement. About this, al-Baladhiri writes the following: \n“Fatima (x) said to Abu Bakr, ‘The Messenger of Allah had appropriated \nFadak to me. Therefore, give it to me.’ He asked her for a witness other \nthan Umm Ayman, saying, ‘O daughter of the Prophet (h)! You know \nthat testimony is not admissible except by two men or one man and two \nwomen.” \nAfter these facts, there remains no possibility of denying that \nFadak was the personal property of the Prophet (h) and that he had \ncompleted its gifting to her by handing over possession in his own \nlifetime. But Abu Bakr took over its possession and dislodged her from it. \nIn this regard, he rejected the testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman on the \nground that the requirement of testimony was not completed when only \none man and one woman testify. Besides them, Imam Hassan and Imam \nHussain (x), too, testified in support for Fatima (x), but their testimony, \ntoo, was rejected on the ground that the testimony of the offspring and \n“minors” was not acceptable in favor of their parents. Then Rabah, slave \nof the Holy Prophet (h), was also produced as a witness in support for \nthe claim of Fatima (x), brining the number of witnesses to five. But the \ntestimony of the virtuous Rabah, too, was rejected (Fath al-Buldan, al-\nBaladhiri, Vol. 1, p. 35; Tarikh, al-Ya`qubi, Vol. 3, p. 195; Muruj al-\nDhahab, al-Mas`udi, Vol. 3, p. 237; Al-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al-Askari, p. \n209; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. 3, pp. 999, 1000-1001; Mu’jam al-Buldan, \nYaqut al-Hamawi, Vol. 4, p. 239; Sharh, Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 16, pp. \n216, 219-220, 274; Al-Muhalla, Ibn Hazm, Vol. 6, p. 507; Al-Sira al-\nHalabiyya, Vol. 3, p. 361; At-Tafsir, al-Fakhr ar-Radi, Vol. 29, p. 284). \nAt this stage, the question arises that when Fatima’s possession of \nFadak is admitted, as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) also clarifies in this \nletter by saying, “We had Fadak in our possession,” what was the \nmeaning of asking Fatima (x) to produce testimony in support for her \nclaim since the onus of proof does not lie on the person with the claim of \nownership? The onus of proof lies on the person filing a counter claim, an \nobjection, because possession itself constitutes a proof. As such, it was \nAbu Bakr who was required to produce a proof to the lawfulness of his \nown taking the contested land from its owner. In the case, if he is unable \nto do so, Fatima’s possession will mean an testimony of her lawful \nownership. As such, it will be wrong to ask her to produce some more \nproof or testimony on her own. \n \nIt is strange that when other claims of this nature came before \nAbu Bakr, he arbitrated them in favor of the claimant merely on the basis \nof the claim: The claimant is neither asked to provide proof of his claim \nnor to produce witnesses. Why did Abu Bakr apply a different standard in \nthe case of “Sayyidatu Nisaa’ al-‘Aalameen”? Did he hold the daughter of \nthe Prophet (k) as a liar? Or did he have other political objectives in \nmind when he treated her with such injustice? In this regard, the \ntraditionists write the following: “It is related from Jabir ibn `Abdillah al-\nAnsari that he said that the Messenger of Allah (k) had said that when \nthe booty from Bahrain arrived, he would allow him such-and-such of it, \nbut the booty did not arrive till the Prophet’s death. When it arrived \nduring the days of Abu Bakr, he went to the latter to claim it. Abu Bakr \nmade the announcement that whoever had a claim against the Messenger \nof Allah or against whomsoever he had made a promise should come for \nhis claim. So, I went to him and told him that the Prophet (h) had \npromised to give me such-and- such property out of the booty from \nBahrain whereupon he gave me all of that” (Sahih, al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, pp. \n119, 209, 236; Vol. 4, p. 110; Vol. 5, p. 218; Sahih, Muslim, Vol. 7, pp. \n75-76; Al-Jami’ al-Sahih, al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, p. 129; Al-Musnad, Ahmed \nibn Hanbal, Vol. 3, pp. 307-308; Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 2, \npart 2, pp.88-89). \n \nIn the annotations of this tradition, Shihabud-Din Ahmed ibn Ali \n(Ibn Hajar) al-Asqalani ash-Shafi’i (773/1372-852/1449) and Badrud-Din \nMahmud ibn Ahmed al-Ayni al-Hanafi (762/1361-855/1451) have written \nthe following: “This tradition leads to the conclusion that the testimony of \none equitable companion can be admitted as full testimony [equal to two \nor more] even though it may be in his own personal favor because Abu \nBakr did not ask Jabir to produce any [other] witness to prove his claim. \n(Fath al-Bari fi Sharh Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 5, p. 380; Umdatul-Qari fi \nSharh Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 12, p. 121). \n \nIf it is lawful to grant property to Jabir on the basis of good \nimpression about him without calling for witness or testimony anyone at \nall, then what stopped allowing Fatima’s claim on the basis of similar \ngood impressions? Or was Abu Bakr ’s impression of the Head of the \nWomen of Mankind not good at all? If good impression could exist in the \ncase of Jabir to such an extent that he would not benefit by speaking a lie, \nthen why should there not be the good belief about Fatima (x) that she \nwould not attribute a false saying to the Prophet (h) just for a piece of \nland? Firstly, her admitted truthfulness and honesty was enough for \nholding her truthful in her claim. Moreover, the testimony of Ali and \nUmm Ayman in her favor was also available besides other evidences. It \nhas been said that the claim could not be decided in favor of Fatima (x)\non the basis of these two witnesses because the Holy Quran lays down the \nprinciple of testimony that: “... .then call to witness two witnesses from \namong your men and if there not be two men, then a man and two men” \n(Holy Quran, 2: 282). \n \nIf this principle is universal and general, then it should be taken \ninto regard on every occasion, not selectively. But on some occasions, it \nis found not to have been followed at all. For example, when an Arab had \na dispute with the Prophet (h) about a camel, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-\nAnsari gave testimony in favor of the Prophet (h), and this one single \nwitness was deemed to be equal to two because there was no doubt in the \nhonesty and truthfulness of this individual in whose favor the testimony \nwas led. It was for this reason that the Holy Prophet (h) granted him the \ntitle of “Dhul-Shahadatayn” (i.e. one whose testimony is equivalent to \nthat of two) (al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, p. 24; Vol. 6, p. 146; Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, \np. 308; al-Nisa’i, Vol. 7, p. 302; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 5, pp. 188, 189, \n216; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 2, p. 448; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 2, p. 114; Al-Isaba, \nVol. 1, pp. 425-426; Al-Musannaf, as-Sanani, Vol. 8, pp. 366-368). \n \nConsequently, neither was the generality of the verse about \ntestimony affected by this action, nor was it deemed to be against the \ncannons of testimony. So, if here, in view of the Prophet’s truthfulness, \none testimony in his favor was deemed to be equal to two, then could not \nthe testimony of Ali and Umm Ayman be regarded sufficient Fatima (x)\nin view of her moral greatness and truthfulness? Besides, this verse does \nnot show that there can be no other way of establishing a claim other than \nthese two methods. In this regard, judge Nurullah al-Mar’ashi at-Tustari \n(956/1549-1019/1610) has written the following in Ihqaq-al-Haqq, \nchapter on al-Mata’in: “The view of the contention that Umm Ayman’s \ntestimony remained incomplete is wrong on the grounds that from certain \ntraditions, it is seen that it is lawful to give a decision on the basis of one \nsingle witness, and it does not necessarily mean that the injunction of the \nHoly Quran has been violated because this verse means that a decision \ncan be given on the strength of the testimony of two men or one man and \ntwo women and that their testimony is enough. From this, it does not \nappear that if there are some other grounds besides the testimony of \nwitnesses that are unacceptable and that verdict cannot be given on its \nbasis, unless it is argued that this is the only meaning for this verse. But \nsince every meaning is not a final argument, this notion can be brushed \naside, particularly because the tradition clearly points to a contrary notion \nand ignoring the notion does not necessarily mean violating the verse. \nSecondly, the verse allows a choice between the testimony of two men or \nthat of one man and two women. If, by virtue of the tradition, a third \nchoice is added, namely that a verdict can be passed by means of other \ntestimony as well, then how does it necessitate that the Quranic verse \nshould stand violated?!” \n \nIn any case, from this reply, it is clear that a claimant is not \nobligated to produce the testimony of two men or that of one man and two \nwomen in support for the claim. This is so because if there is one witness \nand the claimant swears an oath, he can then be taken to have legitimacy \nin his claim and a decision can be given in his favor. In this regard, it has \nbeen narrated by more than twelve companions of the Holy Prophet (h)\nthat the Messenger of Allah (h) used to decide cases on the strength of \none single witness and the taking of an oath. \n \nIt has been explained by some companions of the Prophet (h)\nand by some scholars of jurisprudence that this decision is specially \nrelated to rights, property and transactions, and this decision was \npracticed by the three caliphs: Abu Bakr, `Umar and Othman (Muslim, \nVol. 5, p. 128; Abu DawÅd, Vol. 3, pp. 308-309; al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 3, pp. \n627-629; Ibn Majah, Vol. 2, p. 793; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, pp. 248, \n315, 323; Vol. 3, p. 305; Vol. 5, p. 285; Malik ibn Anas, Al-Muwatta’, \nVol. 2, pp. 721-725; al-Bayhaqi, Al-Sunan al-Kubra, Vol. 10, pp. 167-\n176; Al-Sunan, al-Dar Qutni, Vol. 4, pp. 212-215; Majma’az-Zawa’id, \nVol. 4, p. 202; Kanz al-`Ummal, Vol. 7, p. 13). \nWhen decisions were issued based on the strength of one \nwitness and one oath, then even if in Abu Bakr’s view the requirement of \ntestimony was incomplete, he should have asked her to swear an oath then \ngive a decision in her favor. But here the very objective was to tarnish the \nimage of truthfulness of Fatima (x) so that in the future the question of \nher testimony should not arise. \n \nHowever, when Fatima’s claim was rejected in this manner and \nFadak was not accepted as the Prophet’s gift to her, she claimed it on the \nbasis of inheritance saying: “If you do not agree that the Prophet (h) had \ngifted it to me, you cannot at least deny that Fadak and the revenues of \nKhaybar as well as the lands around Medina were the Prophet’s personal \nproperties and I am his only heir.” Yet she was deprived of her \ninheritance on the basis of a tradition related by Abu Bakr himself that the \nHoly Prophet (h) said, “We, prophets, have no successors, and whatever \nwe leave behind constitutes charity” (al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, p. 96; Vol. 5, pp. \n25-26, 115, 117; Vol. 8, p. 185; Muslim, Vol. 5, pp. 153-155; al-Tirmidhi, \nVol. 4, pp. 157-158; Abu Dawud, Vol. 3, pp. 142-143; al-Nisa’i, Vol. 7, \np. 132; Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, pp. 4, 6, 9, 10; al-Bayhaqi, Vol. 6, p. \n300; Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 2, part 2, pp. 86-87; al-Tabari, Vol. 1, p. 1825; Tarikh \nal-Khamis, Vol. 2, pp. 173-174). \n \nBesides Abu Bakr, nobody else had any knowledge of this \nstatement which was presented to the public as a tradition of the Prophet \n(h), nor had anyone from among the companions heard it at all. Who is \nthe truthful one, Fatima (x) or Abu Bakr? Thus, Jalalu’d-Din `Abd ar-\nRahman ibn Abu Bakr al-Sayyuti ash-Shafi’i (849/1445-911/1505) and \nShihabud-Din Ahmed ibn Muhammad (Ibn Hajar) al-Haytami ash-Shafi’i \n(909/1504-974/1567) have written the following: “After the death of the \nProphet (h), there was a difference of opinion about inheritance and no \none had any information in this matter. Then, Abu Bakr said that he had \nheard the Messenger of Allah saying, ‘We, prophets, leave no successors, \nand whatever we leave behind constitutes charity’” (Tarikh al-Khulafa’, \np.73; Al-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqa, p. 19). \n \nThe mind refuses to believe that the Prophet (h) should not tell \nthose individuals who could be deemed as his successors that they would \nnot inherit and inform a third party that did not have even the most remote \nkinship to him, that there would be no heir/successor to him. Is not AbÅ\nBakr considered as a “successor” of the Prophet (k) by many people?! Is \nthere no contradiction here?! Then this story was made public only when \nthe issue of Fadak was raised in the court of Abu Bakr who himself \nconstituted the contesting party! In such circumstances, how can his \npresenting in his own support a tradition which no one else at all had ever \nheard be deemed permissible? If it is argued that this tradition should be \nrelied upon in view of the greatness of the status of Abu Bakr, then why \ncan Fatima’s claim to the said gift not be relied upon because of her \nhonesty and truthfulness, more so when the testimony of Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) and that of Umm Ayman, as well as of others as well, was \nalso in her favor? If necessity was felt to call more witnesses in her case, \nthen testimony can also be called for regarding this alleged unheard-of \n“tradition”, particularly since this “tradition” contradicted the general \ninstructions of the Holy Quran relevant to the issue of succession and \ninheritance. How can a tradition which is weak in the manner of its \nrelating and altered and the authenticity of which is questioned on the \nbasis of facts to the contrary be deemed to specify a generality of the \nQuranic injunction on inheritance/succession because the question of the \ninheritance of the prophets is clearly mentioned in the Holy Quran. In this \nregard, Allah says the following: “... And Solomon inherited David” \n(Holy Quran, 27: 16). So, prophets do leave heirs/successors... \n \nAt another place, the following is stated by prophet Zakariyya: \n“... Grant me from Yourself an heir who shall inherit me and inherit the \nfamily of Jacob” (Holy Quran, 19: 5-6). So, prophets do leave \nheirs/successors...\n \nIn these verses, succession refers to inheriting estates, etc. To take \nit in its figurative meaning of succession in prophetic knowledge would \nnot only be absurd but also against established facts because knowledge \nand Prophethood are not objects of succession, nor do they possess the \nquality of transmission through inheritance, for in that case, all the \ndescendants of the prophets would have been prophets. There is no sense \nin making a distinction that the progeny of some prophets may inherit \nProphethood while others should remain deprived of it. It is strange that \nthe theory of transmission of Prophethood through inheritance is \npropagated by those who have always laid the objection against the Sh`as\nthat they regard the Imamate and the caliphate as an objective of \ninheritance and confined to one family only. Would not Prophethood \nbecome an objective of inheritance by taking succession in this verse to \nmean succession to the Prophethood? \n \nIf, in Abu Bakr’s view, by virtue of this tradition, there could be \nno successor of the Prophet (h), then where was this tradition when a \ndocument had been written admitting Fatima’s claim for succession? \nThus, Nurud-Din Ali ibn Ibrahim al-Halabi ash-Shafi’i (975/1567-\n1044/1635) quotes Shamsu’d-Din Yusuf (Sibt ibn al-Jawzi) al-Hanafi \n(581/1185-654/1256) narrating the following: “Abu Bakr was on the \npulpit when Fatima (x) came to him and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! The Holy \nQuran should allow your daughter to inherit you, yet I am not to inherit \nmy father!’ Abu Bakr started weeping and descended from the pulpit. \nThen he wrote her a statement about Fadak. At that time, Umar arrived \nand inquired what the written sheet was all about. Abu Bakr replied, ‘It is \na document which I have written for Fatima (x) about the inheritance \nfrom her father.’ Umar said, ‘What will you spend on the Muslims while \nthe Arabs are waging war against you, as you see?’ Then Umar took the \ndocument and tore it to pieces” (Al-Sira al-Halabiyya, Vol. 3, pp. 361-\n362).\n \nEvery sensible person who takes note of this behavior can easily \nreach the conclusion that this tradition is concocted and wrong. It was \nfabricated only to secure possession of Fadak and other inheritances. \nConsequently, Fatima (x) refused to accept it and expressed her anger in \nthis way: She made a will about Abu Bakr and `Umar that the two should \nnot participate in her funeral prayers. Aisha narrated the following: \n“Fatima (x), the daughter of the Holy Prophet (h), sent for Abu Bakr \n(after he became caliph following the death of the Holy Prophet (h)\nclaiming from him her inheritance left for her by the Messenger of Allah \nfrom what Allah had bestowed (specifically) upon him in Medna and \nFadak and what was left from the fifth (khums) of the income from \nKhaybar. Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima (x).\nThen, Fatima (x) became angry with Abu Bakr and forsook him and did \nnot talk to him till the end of her life. When she died, her husband, Ali ibn \nAbu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her \ndeath and performed the funeral prayers for her personally” (al-Bukhari, \nVol. 5, p. 177; Vol. 8, p. 185; Muslim, Vol. 5, pp. 153-155; al-Bayhaqi, \nVol. 4, p. 29; Vol. 6, pp. 300-301; Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 2, part 2, p. 86; Ahmed \nibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, p. 9; al-Tabari, Vol. 1, p. 1825; Ibn Kathir, Tarikh, \nVol. 5, pp. 285-286; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 6, p. 46 and Wafa’ al-\nWafa’,Vol. 3, p. 995). \n \nIn this regard, Umm Ja`far, the daughter of Muhammad ibn \nJa`far, narrated the following about the request of Fatima (x), who was \nnearing her death, to Asma’ daughter of `Umays: “When I die, I want you \nand Ali to wash me and do not allow anyone to go into my house.” \nWhen she died, Aisha came to enter, but Asma’ said to her, “Do \nnot enter.” Aisha complained to Abu Bakr (her father) saying, “This \nKhath’amiyya (woman from the tribe of Kath’am) intervenes between us \nand the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (h).” Abu Bakr came out, \nstood at the door and said, “O Asma’! What makes you prevent the wives \nof the Prophet (h) from entering to see the daughter of the Messenger of \nAllah?” Asma’ replied, “She had herself ordered me not to allow anyone \nto enter.” Abu Bakr said, “Do what she has ordered you” (Hilyat al-\nAwliya’, Vol. 2, p. 43; Al-Sunan al-Kubra, Vol. 3, p. 396; Vol. 4, p. 334; \nAnsab al-Ashraf, Vol. 1, p. 405; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, pp. 1897-1898; Usd al-\nGhaba, Vol. 5, p. 524; Al-Isaba, Vol. 4, pp. 378-379). \n \nFatima (x) had also made a request to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nthat she must be buried at night, that no one should come to her, that Abu \nBakr and Umar should not be notified about her death and burial, and that \nAbu Bakr should not be allowed to perform the funeral prayer for her. \n \nWhen she died, Ali washed and buried her in the dark of the night \nwithout notifying Abu Bakr and Umar. So, these two were not aware of \nher burial. \n \nMuhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi (130/747-207/823) said the \nfollowing: “It has been proven to us that Ali (x) performed her funeral \nprayers and buried her at night accompanied by al-Abbas (ibn Abdul-\nMuttalib) and (his son) al-Fadl and did not notify anyone.” \n \nIt was for this reason that the burial place of Fatima (x) is hidden \nand is unknown, none alive is sure about it (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, pp. \n162-163; Al-Musannaf, Vol. 4, p. 141; Ansab al-Ashraf, Vol. 1, pp. 402, \n405; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, p. 1898; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 5, pp. 524-525; Al-\nIsaba, Vol. 4, pp. 379-380; al-Tabari, Vol. 3, pp. 2435-2436; Ibn Sa`d, \nVol. 8, pp. 19-20; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. 3, pp. 901-902, 904, 905; Ibn \nAbul-Hadid, Vol. 16, pp. 279-281). \n \nTo attribute this displeasure of Fatima (x) to sentiments and \nthereby to lower its importance does not prompt a correct sentiment: If \nthis displeasure had been the result of sentiments, Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) would have stopped her from this out-of-place displeasure, but \nthere is no historical record showing that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\ntook this displeasure to be as such. Besides, how could her displeasure be \nthe result of personal feelings or sentiments since her pleasure or \ndispleasure always agree with Allah’s will? The Prophet’s following \nsaying is a proof of this: “O Fatima (x)! Surely Allah is angered when you \nare angered and is pleased when you are pleased” (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, \np. 153; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 5, p. 522; Al-Isaba, Vol. 4, p. 366; Tahthib al-\nTahthib, Vol. 12, p. 441; Al-Khasa’is al-Kubra, Vol. 2, p. 265; Kanz al-\nUmmal, Vol. 13, p. 96; Vol. 16, p. 280; Majma’ al-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, p. \n203).\nA short history of Fadak after the death of Fatima (x):\n \nThe motive which prompts us to pursue the history of Fadak and \nto extract the series of events after it for a period of three centuries from \nthe texts of historical books is to clarify three issues: \n \na. The truth about the rule of annulment of inheritance from \nprophets allegedly made by the Holy Prophet (h); in other words, the \nclaim that property of the Holy Prophet (h) is a part of the public \ntreasury and belongs to all Muslims. This was claimed by the first caliph, \nAbu Bakr, and was rejected by his successors, by both next caliphs \n(`Umar and Othman), by the Umayyads and the Abbassids. We must \nconsider that the lawfulness and rightfulness of their caliphate depended \nupon the “correctness” and “lawfulness” of the caliphate of the first caliph \nand his actions. \n \nb. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and the descendants of Fatima (x)\nnever had any hesitation regarding the rightfulness and justification of \ntheir claim. They emphasized and confirmed that Fatima (x) had always \nbeen right and that Abu Bakr’s claim had always been rejected; they did \nnot yield to the false claim. \n \nc. Whenever one of the caliphs made a decision to put Allah’s \ncommand into effect, with regard to Fadak, to observe justice and equity \nand to restore the right to the entitled one in conformity with Islamic \nrules, he used to return Fadak to the descendants of Fatima (x).\n \n`Umar ibn al-Khattab was the most harsh person in keeping \nFatima (x) from Fadak and her inheritance as he himself confessed: \n“When the Messenger of Allah died, I came along with Abu Bakr to Ali \nibn Abu Talib and said, ‘What do you say about what has been left by the \nMessenger of Allah?’ He replied, ‘We have the most rights with the Holy \nProphet (h).’ I (Umar) said, ‘Even those properties of Khaybar?’ He \nsaid, ‘Yes, even those of Khaybar.’ I said, ‘Even those of Fadak?’ He \nreplied, ‘Yes, even those of Fadak.’ Then I said, ‘By Allah! We say NO \neven if you cut our necks with saws’” (Majma’ al-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, pp. \n39-40).\n \nAs it has been mentioned before, `Umar then took the document \n(title of ownership) of Fadak and tore it up. But when Umar became \ncaliph (13/634-23/644), he gave Fadak back to inheritors of the Holy \nProphet (h). Yaqut al-Hamawi (574/1178-626/1229), the famous \nhistorian and geographer, following the event of Fadak, said the \nfollowing: “Then, when `Umar ibn al-Khattab became caliph and gained \nvictories and the Muslims secured abundant wealth (i.e. the public \ntreasury satisfied the caliphate’s needs), he made his judgement contrary \nto that of his predecessor. He gave it (Fadak) back to the Prophet’s heirs. \nAt the time, Ali ibn Abu Talib and Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib disputed \nabout Fadak.” \n \nAli said that the Holy Prophet (h) had bestowed it on Fatima (x)\nduring his lifetime. Abbas denied this and used to say, “This was in the \npossession of the Holy Prophet (h) and I have a share in this \ninheritance.” They were disputing this with each other and asked Umar to \nsettle the case. He refused to judge between them and said, “Both of you \nare more conscious and aware of your problem; but I only give it [Fadak] \nto you” (Mu’jam al-Buldan, Vol. 4, pp. 238-239; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. 3, \np. 999; Tahthib al-Lughah, Vol. 10, p. 124; Lisan al-Arab, Vol. 10, p. \n473; Taj al-Arus, Vol. 7, p. 166). \n \nThe reason why Umar and Abu Bakr were trying to seize Fadak \nwas economic and political, not merely a religious one, as the previous \nepisode shows. When the economic and political condition of the \ncaliphate improved, and when there was no need for the income obtained \nfrom Fadak, Omer changed his own decision. \n \nThe last part of this historic event has been inserted afterwards to \ndemonstrate the matter of inheritance by the brother or paternal uncle of \nthe deceased when the latter had no sons. This problem is a matter of \ndispute among Islamic sects. The judicial and jurisprudential discussion is \nseparate from our own goal in the writing of this book. We are only \ndiscussing the matter historically. \nAbbas had no claim in this case because he had not proven that he \nhad a share in this property, nor did his descendants consider it to be \namong their own assets even when they [the Abbasides] became caliphs \nand were ruling the Islamic lands. They either considered themselves as \nowners of this estate in their capacity as caliphs, or they used to return it \nto the descendants of Fatima (x) when they had decided to be just \ngovernors.\n \nWhen Othman ibn Affan became caliph, following the death of \nUmar (23/644-35/656), he granted Fadak to Marwan ibn al-Hakam, his \ncousin (Al-Sunan al-Kubra, Vol. 6, p. 301; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. 3, p. \n1000; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 1, p. 198) and this was one of the causes of \nhostile feelings among the Muslims against `Othman (Al-Ma’arif, Ibn \nQutaybah, p. 195; Al-Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, pp. 283, 435; Tarikh, Abul-\nFida’, Vol. 1, p. 168; Tarikh, Ibn al-Wardi, Vol. 1, p. 204) which ended in \nthe rebellion against him and in his murder. “While previously Fatima (x)\nused to claim it, sometimes as her inheritance and sometimes as a gift \n(from her father), she was driven away from it (Fadak) as Ibn Abul-Hadid \nsaid” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha). In this way, Fadak fell into the possession \nof Marwan. He used to sell its crops and products for at least ten thousand \ndinars per year. If in some years its income decreased, this drop was not \nmade public. This was its usual profit till the time of the caliphate of \nUmar ibn Abdul-Aziz (in 100/718) (Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 5, pp. 286, 287; Subh \nal-A’sha, Vol. 4, p. 291). \n \nWhen Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan became caliph (41/661-\n60/680), he became partner with Marwan and others in Fadak. He allotted \none third to Marwan, one third to Amr son of Othman ibn Affan and one \nthird to his own son Yazid. This was after the death of al-Hassan ibn Ali \n(x). “In order to cause the anger of the progeny of the Holy Prophet (h), \nas al-Ya`qubi states on p. 199, Vol. 2 of his Tarikh, it remained in the \npossession of the three above-mentioned persons tlil Marwan became \ncaliph (64/684-65/685); he took full possession of it. Then he doled it out \nto his two sons, Abdul-Malik and Abdul-Aziz. Then Abdul-Aziz doled \nout his share to his son (`Umar ibn Abdul-Azz).\n \nWhen Umar ibn Abdul-Aziz became caliph (99/717-101/720), he \ndelivered a sermon once in which he said, “Verily, Fadak was among the \nthings that Allah had bestowed on His Messenger and no horse, nor camel \nwas stirred for it.” He mentioned the history of the case of Fadak during \nthe past caliphates till he said the following: “Then Marwan [ibn al-\nHakam] gave it (Fadak) to my father and to Abdul-Malik. It became mine \nas well as al-Walid’s and Sulayman’s (two sons). When al-Walid became \ncaliph (86/705-96/715), I asked him for his share and he gave it to me. I \nalso asked for Sulayman’s share and he, too, gave it to me. Then I \ngathered the three parts and I then possessed no property more dear to me \nthan it. Testify that I returned it to its original condition.” He wrote to his \ngovernor of Medina (Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Amr ibn Hazm) \nordering him to carry out what he had declared in the sermon which he \nhad delivered. Then Fadak went back to the possession of the children of \nFatima (x). “This was the first removal of oppression by returning it \n(Fadak) to the children of Ali” (Al-Awa’il, Abu Hilal al-Askari, p. 209). \nThey possessed it during the reign of this caliph [Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]. \n \nWhen Yazid ibn Abdul-Malik became caliph (101/720-105/724), \nhe seized Fadak and they (the children of Ali) were again dispossessed. It \nfell into the possession of the children of Marwan as it had been \npreviously. They passed it from one to another tlil their caliphate expired; \nit was then that it passed away to Banu al-Abbas. \n \nWhen “Abul-Abbas” Abdullah as-Saffah became the first caliph \nof the Abbasid dynasty (132/749-136/754), he gave Fadak back to the \nchildren of Fatima (x), handing it over to Abdullah ibn al-Hassan ibn al-\nHassan [known as al-Hassan al-Muthanna or al-Hassan II] ibn Ali ibn \nAbu Talib(x). When “Abu Ja`far” Abdullah al-Mansur ad-Dawaniqi \n(136/754-158/775) became caliph, he seized Fadak from the children of \nal-Hassan (x). When Muhammad al-Mahdi, son of al-Mansur, became \ncaliph (158/775-169/785), he returned Fadak to the children of Fatima \n(x). Then Musa al-Hadi ibn al-Mahdi (169/785-170/786) and his brother \nHarun ar-Rashid (170/786-193/809) confiscated it from the descendants \nof Fatima (x), and it found itself in the possession of Banu al-Abbas till \nthe time when al-Ma’mun became caliph (193/813-218/833). Al-Ma’mun \nal-Abbasi gave it back to the descendants of Fatima (x) (210/826). It is \nnarrated through al-Mahdi ibn Sabiq that al-Ma’mun one day sat to hear \nthe complaints of the people and to judge in their disputes. The first \ncomplaint which he received caused him to weep upon considering it. \nWhen he asked where the attorney for the children of Fatima (x)\ndaughter of the Holy Prophet (h) was, an old man stood up and came \nforth. He argued with him about Fadak, and al-Ma’mun, too, argued till \nhe won the argument over al-Ma’mun (Al-Awa’il, p. 209). Al-Ma’mun \nsummoned the Islamic faqihs and questioned them about the claim of \nBanu Fatima (x). They narrated to al-Ma’mun saying that the Holy \nProphet (h) gave Fadak to Fatima (x) as a gift and that after the death of \nthe Holy Prophet (h), Fatima (x) demanded Abu Bakr to return Fadak to \nher. He asked her to bring witnesses to her claim regarding this gift. She \nbrought Ali, al-Hassan, al-Hussain and Umm Ayman as her witnesses. \nThey testified in the case in her favor. Abu Bakr rejected their testimony. \nThen al-Ma’mun asked the Islamic faqihs: “What is your view about \nUmm Ayman?” They replied, “She is a woman to whom the Holy \nProphet (h) testified that she is a resident of Paradise.” Al-Ma’mun \ndisputed at length with them and forced them to accept his argument. \nThey finally confessed that Ali, al-Hassan, al-Hussain and Umm Ayman \nhad testified only to the truth. When they unanimously adopted this stand, \nhe restored Fadak to the descendants of Fatima (x) (Tarikh, al-Ya`qubi, \nVol. 3, pp. 195-196). \n \nThen al-Ma’mun ordered the estate (of Fadak) to be registered \namong the property (of the descendants of Fatima [x]), and it was \nregistered; al-Ma’mun signed it. Then he wrote a letter to his governor in \nMedina, namely Qutham ibn Ja`far, as follows: \nBe informed that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), exercising the \nauthority vested upon him by the divine religion as the Caliph, successor \nand kinsman of the Holy Prophet (h), has considered himself more \ndeserving to follow the precedent of the Holy Prophet (h) and to carry \nout his commands. And (the chief is more entitled) to restore to the \nrightful persons any endowment gifted by the Holy Prophet (h) or \nanything which the Holy Prophet (h) had gifted to anyone. The success \nand safeguarding of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) is done by Allah, and he \nis particularly anxious to act in a way which would win the pleasure of \nthe Almighty for him. Verily, the Holy Prophet (h) had gifted the estate \nof Fadak to his daughter Fatima (x). He had transferred its ownership to \nher. It is a clear and an established fact. None of the kindred of the Holy \nProphet (h) have any difference of view in this regard. Fatima (x)\nalways claimed that which was more deserving (to be justified) than the \nperson (Abu Bakr) whose word was accepted. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(xn ) considers it right and proper to restore Fadak to the heirs of Fatima \n(x). He would hereby win nearness to Allah Almighty by establishing \nHis justice and right. It will win the appreciation of the Holy Prophet \n(h) by carrying into effect his commandments. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) has commanded that this restoration of Fadak should duly be \nregistered. This command should be transmitted to all the officials. \n \nThen, if, as it was a custom to proclaim on every hajj gathering \n(every year), following the death of the Holy Prophet (h), that anyone to \nwhom the Holy Prophet (h) had promised by way of a gift or a present \nshould come forward, his statement will be accepted and the promise will \nthus be fulfilled. Certainly, Fatima (x) had a superior right to have her \nstatements accepted in the matter of the gifting of Fadak by the Holy \nProphet (h) to her. \n \nVerily, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has commanded his slave \nMubarak al-Tabari to restore Fadak to the descendants of Fatima (x) the \ndaughter of the Holy Prophet (h) with all its borders, rights and slaves \nattached thereto, cereal crops and other things. \n \nThe same has been restored to Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn al-\nHassan ibn Zayd ibn Ali ibn al-Hussain ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and \nMuhammad ibn `Abdullah ibn al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn al-Hussain ibn Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x).\n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has appointed both of them as the \nagents representing the owners of the lands: the heirs of Fatima (x). Be \nthen informed that this is the view of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and \nthat Allah has inspired him to obey the order of Allah and to win His \npleasure and the pleasure of the Holy Prophet (h). Let also your \nsubordinates know this. Behave towards Muhammad ibn Yahya and \nMuhammad ibn Abdillah in the same manner as you used to behave \ntowards Mubarak al-Tabari. Help them both to everything which has \nanything to do with its flourishing and prosperity, its improvement in \nabundance of cereals by Allah’s will, and that is the end of the matter. \n \nWritten this Wednesday, two nights past Dhul-Qi`dah, in the \nyear 210 (February 15, 826 A.D.). \n \nDuring the period of al-Ma’mun’s caliphate, Fadak was in the \npossession of Fatima’s descendants. This continued during the caliphate \nof al-Mu’tasim (218/833-227/842) and that of al-Wathiq (227/842-\n232/847). \nWhen Ja`far al-Mutawakkil became caliph (232/847-247/861), \nthe one among them who was marked as an arch-enemy of the progeny of \nthe Holy Prophet (h), both of those alive and of those dead, gave the \norder to re-seize Fadak from the descendants of Fatima (x). He seized it \nand gave it to Harmalah al-Hajjam (the cupper). After the death of al-\nHajjam, he gave it to al-Bazyar (the falconer, a native of Tabaristan) \n(Kashf al-Ghumma, Vol. 2, pp. 121-122; Bihar al-Anwar, [1st ed.], Vol. \n8, p. 108; Safinat al-Bihar, Vol. 2, p. 351). Abu Hilal al-‘Askari \nmentioned that his name was `Abdullah ibn `Umar al-Bazyar and added: \n“... And there were in it (Fadak) eleven date-palm trees which the Holy \nProphet (h) had planted with his own hands. The descendants of Abu \nTalib used to gather these dates. When pilgrims (hujjaj) entered Medina, \nthese descendants donated the dates to them. Through this, they received \na considerable return. This news reached al-Mutawakkil. He ordered \nAbdullah ibn Umar to gather the fruits and to squeeze the juice from \nthem. Abdullah ibn Umar sent a man named Bishr ibn Umayyah ath-\nThaqafi who squeezed the fruits. It was reported that he made it into wine. \nIt had not reached Basra (on its way to the caliph) before it decayed, and \nby then al-Mutawakkil was killed (Al-Awa’il, p. 209). When al-\nMutawakkil was killed and al-Muntasir (his son) succeeded him \n(247/861-248/862), the latter gave the order to restore Fadak to the \ndescendants of al-Hassan and al-Hussain (x) and delivered the donations \nof Abu Talib to them; this was in 248/862. (Ref. Nos. 3-13, Fath al-\nBuldan, Vol. 1, pp. 33-38; Mu’jam al-Buldan, Vol. 4, pp. 238-240; \nTarikh, al-Ya`qubi, Vol. 2, p. 199; Vol. 3, pp. 48, 195-196; Al-Kamil, Ibn \nal-Athir, Vol. 2, pp. 224-225; Vol. 3, pp. 457, 497; Vol. 5, p. 63; Vol. 7, \np. 116; Al-`Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 4, pp. 216, 283, 435; Wafa’ al-Wafa’, Vol. \n3, pp. 999-1000; Al-Tabaqat al-Kubra, Vol. 5, pp. 286-287; Tarikh al-\nKhulafa’, pp. 231-232, 356; Muruj al-Dhahab, Vol. 4, p. 82; Sirat Umar \nibn Abdul-Aziz, Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 110; Subh al-A’sha, Vol. 4, p. 291; \nJamharat Rasa’il al-`Arab, Vol. 2, pp. 331-332; Vol. 3, pp. 509-510; \nA’lam an-Nisa’, Vol. 3, pp. 1211-1212; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 16, pp. \n277-278; Al-Awa’il, p. 209; Kashf al-Ghumma, Vol. 2, pp. 120-122; \nBihar al-Anwar, Vol. 8, pp. 107-108). \n \nIt seemed that Fadak was re-seized from the descendants of \nFatima (x) after the death of al-Muntasir (248-862) because “Abul-\nHassan” Ali ibn Isa al-Irbili (d. 692/1293) stated that al-Mu’tadid \n(279/892-289/902) returned Fadak to the descendants of Fatima (x). Then \nhe mentioned that al-Muqtafi (289/902-295/908) seized it from them. It is \nsaid also that al-Muqtadir (295/908-320/932) returned it to them (the \ndescendants of Fatima [x]) (Kashf al-Ghumma, Vol. 2, p. 122; Bihar al-\nAnwar, Vol. 8, p. 108; Safina, Vol. 2, p. 351). \n \nAfter this long period of re-seizing and restoring, Fadak was \nreturned to the possession of the usurpers and their heirs. It seems there is \nno further mention that such changing hands was ever made in history, \nand the curtain fell. “Is it then that the judgement of (the times of pagan) \nignorance that they desire? And who (else) can be better than Allah to \njudge for a people of assured faith?” (Holy Quran, 5: 50)."

Do not forsake it so long as you live because if it is \nabandoned, you will not be spared. \n \n(Fear) Allah (and) keep Him in view in the matter of jihad with \nthe help of your property, lives and tongues in the way of Allah. \n \nYou should maintain respect for kinship and spend on others. \nAvoid turning away from one another and severing mutual relations. Do \nnot give up bidding for good and forbidding from evil lest the \nmischievous gain positions over you, then if you pray, your prayers will \nnot be answered. \n \nThen he said the following: O sons of `Abdul-Muttalib! Certainly \nI do not wish to see you plunging harshly into the blood of Muslims \nshouting that Ali ibn Abu Talib has been killed. Beware! Do not kill on \nmy account except the one who kills me. \n \nWait till I die by his (Ibn Muljim’s) existing stroke. Then strike \nhim one single stroke for his single stroke and do not dismember the \nlimbs of the man, for I have heard the Messenger of Allah saying, “Avoid \ncutting limbs even though it may be those of a rabid dog.”"

    "text": "To the Governors of Various Places Concerning Prayers \nOffer the zuhr (noon) prayers with the people when the shade of \nthe wall of the goats’ pen is equal to the wall. Offer the asr (afternoon) \nprayers with them when the sun is still shining in a portion of the day \nenough for covering the distance of two farasangs (about six miles). Offer \nthe maghrib (sunset) prayers when whoever is fasting ends the fast and \nthe pilgrim rushes (from Arafat) to Mina. Offer the isha’ (evening) \nprayers with them when twilight disappears and upto one third of the \nnight. Say the (early) morning prayers with them when a man can \nrecognize the face of his companion. Say the prayers with the people as \nthe weakest of them would do, and do not be a source of trouble to them. \n \n \nDocument1 Of Instruction 53 \nWritten for (Malik) al-Ashtar an-Nakh`i, when the status of \nMuhammad ibn Abu Bakr had become precarious and Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) had appointed al-Ashtar as the Governor of Egypt and \nthe surrounding areas. It is the longest document and contains the \ngreatest number of beautiful statements :\nIn the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. \n \nThis is what Allah’s servant Ali ibn Abu Talib has ordered Malik \nibn al-Harith al-Ashtar in his instrument (of appointment) for him when \nhe made him Governor of Egypt for the collection of its revenues, \nfighting its enemies, seeking the good of its people and making its cities \nprosperous.\n \nHe has ordered him to fear Allah, to prefer obedience to Him and \nto follow what He has commanded in His Book (Holy Quran) out of His \nobligatory and elective commands, without following which one cannot \nachieve virtue, nor (can one) be evil save by opposing them and ignoring \nthem and to support the cause of Allah the Glorified One, with his heart, \nhand and tongue because Allah Whose name is Sublime takes the \nresponsibility for helping him who helps Him and for protecting him who \ngives Him support. \n \nHe also orders him to break his heart off from passions and to \nrestrain it at the time of their increase because the heart leads towards evil \nunless Allah has mercy. \nQualifications of a Governor and his Responsibilities :\n \nThen, know, O Malik, that I have sent you to an area where there \nhave been governments before you, both just as well as oppressive. \nPeople would now watch your dealings as you used to watch the dealings \nof the rulers before you and they (people) would criticize you as you \ncriticized them (rulers). Surely, the virtuous are known by the reputation \nthat Allah circulates for them through the tongues of His creatures. \nTherefore, the best collection with you should be the collection of good \ndeeds. So, control your passions and check your heart from doing what is \nnot lawful for you because checking the heart means detaining it just half \nway between what it likes and dislikes. \n \nHabituate your heart to mercy for the subjects and to affection \nand kindness for them. Do not stand over them like greedy beasts who \nfeel it is enough to devour them since they are of two kinds: either your \nbrethren in religion or your likes in creation. They would commit slips \nand encounter mistakes. They may act wrongly, wilfully or out of \nnegligence. So, extend to them your forgiveness and pardon them in the \nsame way as you would like Allah to extend His forgiveness and to \npardon you because you are over them and your responsible Commander \n(Imam) is over you, while Allah is over the one who appointed you. He \n(Allah) has sought you to manage their affairs and tried you through \nthem. \n \nDo not set yourself to fight Allah because you have no power to \nmeet His power and you cannot do without His pardon and mercy. Do not \nregret forgiving or being merciful in punishing. Do not act hastily during \nyour anger if you can find a way out of it. Do not say: “I have been given \nauthority, I enjoy it when I order,” because it engenders confusion in the \nheart, weakens the religion and takes one to his ruin. If the authority in \nwhich you are placed produces pride or vanity in you, look at the \ngreatness of the realm of Allah over you and His might the like of which \nyou do not even possess over yourselves. This will curb your haughtiness, \ncure you of your high temper and bring back to you your wisdom which \nhad gone away from you. \n \nBeware of comparing yourself to Allah in His greatness or \nlikening yourself to Him in His power, for Allah humiliates every \nclaimant of power and disgraces everyone who is haughty. \n \nDo justice for Allah, and do justice towards the people, as against \nyour own selves, your near ones and those of your subjects for whom you \nhave a liking because if you do not do so, you will be oppressive, and \nwhen a person oppresses the servants of Allah, instead of His creatures, \nAllah becomes his opponent and when Allah is the opponent of a person \nHe tramples his plea, and we would remain in the status of being at war \nwith Allah till he gives it up and repents. Nothing is more inducive to the \nreversal of Allah’s bounty or for the hastening of His retribution than \ncontinuance in oppression because Allah hears the prayer of the oppressed \nand is on the look out for the oppressors. \nRuling should be in favor of the people as a whole .\n \nThe way most coveted by you should be that which is the most \nequitable for what is right, the most universal by way of justice and the \nmost comprehensive with regard to the agreement with those under you \nbecause the disagreement among the common people sweeps away the \narguments of the chiefs and can be disregarded when compared with the \nagreement of the common people. No one among those under you is more \nburdensome to the ruler in the comfort of life, less helpful in distress, \nmore disliking of equitable treatment, more tricky in asking favors, less \nthankful at the time of giving, less appreciative of reasons at the time of \nrefusal and weaker in endurance at the time of the discomforts of life than \nthe chiefs. It is the common people of the community who are the pillars \nof the religion, the power of the Muslims and the defence against the \nenemies. Your learning should, therefore, be towards them and your \ninclination with them. \n \nThe one among the people under you who is furthest from you \nand the worst of them in your view should be whoever is the most \ninquisitive of the shortcomings of the people because people do have \nshortcomings and the ruler is the most appropriate person to cover them. \nDo not disclose whatever of it is hidden from you because your obligation \nis to correct what is manifest to you, while Allah will deal with whatever \nis hidden from you. Therefore, cover shortcomings as far as you can; \nAllah will cover those of your shortcomings which you will like to remain \nunder cover from your subjects. Unfasten every knot of hatred in the \npeople and cut away from yourself the cause of every enmity. Feign \nignorance from what is not clear to you. Do not hasten to second a \nbackbiter because a backbiter is a cheat although he looks like those who \nwish well. \nAbout Counselors \nDo not include among those whom you consult a miser who \nwould keep you back from being generous and caution you against \ndestitution, nor a coward who would make you feel too weak for your \naffairs, nor a greedy person who would beautify for you the collection of \nwealth by evil means. This is so because although miserliness, cowardice \nand greed are different qualities, yet they are common in having a wrong \nidea about Allah. \n \nThe worst minister for you is one who has been a minister for \nmischievous persons before you and who joined them in committing sins. \nTherefore, he should not be your chief man because they are abettors of \nsinners and brothers of the oppressors. You can find good substitutes for \nthem who would be like them in their views and influence while not being \nlike them in committing sins and vices. They have never assisted an \noppressor in his oppression or a sinner in his sins. They would give you \nthe least trouble and the best support. They would be most considerate \ntowards you and the least inclined towards others. Therefore, make them \nyour chief companions in privacy as well as in public. \n \nThen, more preferable among them for you should be those who \nopenly speak better truths before you and who support you the least in \nthose of your actions which Allah does not approve in His friends, even \nthough they may be according to your wishes. Associate yourself with \nGod-fearing and truthful people; then educate them, so that they should \nnot praise you or please you by reason of an action which you did not \nperform because an excess of praise produces pride and drives you nearer \nto haughtiness. \n \nThe virtuous and the vicious should not be in equal status before \nyou because this means dissuasion of the virtuous from virtue and \npersuasion of the vicious to vice. Keep everyone in the status which is his. \nYou should know that the most conducive thing for the good impression \nof the ruler on his subjects is that he should extend good behavior towards \nthem, lighten their hardships and avoid putting them to unbearable \ntroubles. You should, therefore, in this way follow a course by which you \nwould leave a good impression with your subjects. This is so because \nsuch good ideas would relieve you of great worries. Certainly, the most \nappropriate for your good impression is he to whom your behavior has not \nbeen good. \n \nDo not discontinue the good lives in which the earlier people of \nthis community had been acting and by virtue of which there was general \nunity and through which the subjects prospered. Do not innovate any line \nof action which injures these earlier ways because (in that case) the \nreward for those who had established those ways would continue, but the \nburden for discontinuing them would be on you. Keep on increasing your \nconversations with the scholars and discussions with the wise in order to \nstabilize the prosperity of the areas under you and to continue with that in \nwhich the earlier people had remained steadfast. \nThe different classes of people:\nBe informed that people consist of classes who prosper only with \nthe help of one another and they are not independent of one another. \nAmong them are the army of Allah, then the secretarial workers of the \ncommon people and the chiefs, then the dispensers of justice, then those \nengaged in enforcing law and order, then the payers of head tax (jizya) \nand land tax (khiraj) from the protected unbelievers and the common \nMuslims, then there are the traders and the men of industry, then the \nlowest class of the needy and the destitute. Allah has fixed the share of \neach one of them and laid down His precepts about the limits of each in \nHis Book (Holy Quran) and in the Sunnah of His Prophet (h) by way of \na settlement which is preserved with us. \n \nThe army is, by the will of Allah, the fortress of the subjects, the \nornament of the ruler, the strength of the religion and the means of \nachieving peace. The subjects cannot exist without them while the army \ncan be maintained only by the funds fixed by Allah in the revenues \nthrough which they acquire the strength to fight the enemies, on which \nthey depend for their prosperity and with which they meet their needs. \nThese two classes cannot exist without the third class, namely: the judges, \nthe executives and the secretaries who pass judgements about contracts, \ncollect revenues and are depended upon in special and general matters. \n \nAnd these classes cannot exist except with the traders and men of \nindustry who provide necessities for them, establish markets and make it \npossible for others not to do all this with their own hands. Then comes the \nlowest class of the needy and the destitute. Support and help for them is \nan obligation, and everyone of them has (a share in) livelihood in the \nName of Allah. Everyone of them has a right on the ruler according to \nwhat is needed for his prosperity. The ruler cannot acquit himself of the \nobligations laid on him by Allah in this matter except by striving and \nseeking help from Allah,October 18, 2003 by training himself to adhere to \nrighteousness and by enduring on that account all that is light or hard. \n1. The Army \nPut in command of your forces the man who in your view is the \nbest well-wisher of Allah, His Prophet (h) and your Imam. The most \nchaste of them in heart and the highest of them in endurance is one who is \nslow in getting angry, who accepts excuses, who is kind to the weak and \nis strict with the strong; violence should not raise his temper and \nweakness should not keep him sitting. \n \nAlso associate with considerate people from high families, \nvirtuous houses and decent traditions, then people of courage, valor, \ngenerosity and benevolence because they are repositories of honor and \nsprings of virtues. Strive for their matters as the parents strive for their \nchild. Do not regard anything that you do to strengthen them as big nor \nanything that you have agreed to do for them as little, even though it may \nbe small because this would make them your well-wishers and create a \ngood impression about you. Do not neglect to attend to their small \nmatters. Confine yourself to their important matters because your small \nfavors will also be of benefit to them while the important ones are such \nthat they cannot ignore. \n \nThat commander of the army should have such a status before \nyou that he renders help to them equitably and spends from his money on \nthem and on those of their families who remain behind so that all their \nworries converge on the one worry to fight the enemy. Your kindness to \nthem would turn their hearts to you. The most pleasant thing for the rulers \nis the establishment of justice in their areas and the manifestation of the \nlove of their subjects, but the subjects’ love manifests itself only when \ntheir hearts are clean. Their good wishes prove correct only when they \nsurround their commanders (to protect them). Do not regard their \npositions to be a burden over them and do not keep watching for the end \nof their tenure. Therefore, be broad-minded with regard to their desires, \ncontinue to praise them and recount the good deeds of those who have \nshown such deeds because the mention of good deeds shakes the brave \nand rouses the weak, if Allah so wills. \nAppreciate the performance of each and every one of them. Do \nnot attribute the performance of one to the other and do not minimize the \nreward below the level of the performance. The high status of a man \nshould not lead you to regard his small deeds as big, nor should the low \nstatus of a man make you regard his big deeds as small. \n \nRefer to Allah and His Prophet (h) the affairs which worry you \nand the matters which seem to confuse you because, addressing the \npeople whom Allah the Sublime wishes to guide, He said the following: \n“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Prophet (h) and those \nvested with authority from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, \nrefer it to Allah and the Prophet (h) if you believe in Allah and in the \nLast Day (of Judgement)” (Holy Quran, 4: 59). \n \nReferring to Allah means acting according to what is clear in His \nBook, and referring to the Prophet (h) means following his unanimously \nagreed upon Sunnah with regard to which there are no differences. \n2. The Chief Judge [Supreme Court Justice]\nFor the settlement of disputes among people, select one who is \nthe most distinguished among your subjects in your view. The cases \n(coming before him) should not vex him, disputation should not enrage \nhim. He should not insist on any wrong point and should not hesitate to \naccept the truth when he perceives it; he should not lean towards greed \nand should not content himself with a cursory understanding (of a matter) \nwithout going thoroughly into it. He should be most ready to stop (to \nponder) on doubtful points, most considerate of arguments, least \ndisgusted at the quarrel of litigants, most patient at probing into matters \nand most fearless at the time of passing a judgement. Praise should not \nmake him vain and elation should not make him lean (toward any side). \nSuch people are very few. \nThen, very often check his decisions and allow him so much \nmoney (as remuneration) that he has no excuse worth hearing (for not \nbeing honest) and there remains no occasion for him to go to others for \nhis needs. Give him that rank in your audience for which no one else \namong your chiefs aspires so that he may remain safe from the harm of \nthose around you. You should have a piercing eye in this matter because \nthis religion has formerly been a prisoner in the hands of vicious persons \nwhen action was taken according to passion and worldly wealth was \nsought.\n3. Executive Officers \nLook into the affairs of your executives. Give them appointment \nafter testing them and do not appoint them according to partiality or \nfavoritism because these two things make up the sources of injustice and \nunfairness. Select from among them those who are people of experience \nand modesty, hailing from virtuous houses, having been previously in \nIslam because such persons possess high manners and untarnished honor. \nThey are the least inclined towards greed and always have their eyes on \nthe ends of matters. \n \nGive them an abundant livelihood (by way of salary) because this \ngives them the strength to maintain themselves in order and not to have an \neye upon the funds in their custody and it will be an argument against \nthem if they disobeyed your orders or misappropriated your trust. You \nshould also check their activities and assign people to report on them who \nshould be truthful and faithful because your watching their actions \nsecretly would urge them to preserve trust with and to be kind to the \npeople. Be careful of assistants. If any one of them extends his hands \ntowards misappropriation and the reports of your reporters reaching you \nconfirm it, that should be regarded as sufficient testimony. You should \nthen inflict corporal punishment on him and recover what he has \nmisappropriated. You should put him in a place of disgrace, blacklist him \nwith (the charge of) misappropriation and make him wear the necklace of \nshame for his offence. \n4. The Administration of Revenues \nLook after the revenue (khiraj, land tax) affairs in such a way that \nthose engaged in it remain prosperous because in their prosperity lies the \nprosperity of all others. The others cannot prosper without them because \nall people are dependent on the revenue and on its payers. You should \nalso keep an eye on the cultivation of the land more than on the collection \nof revenue because revenue cannot be obtained without cultivation and \nwhoever asks for revenue without cultivation ruins the area and brings \ndeath to the people. His rule will not last but only for a moment. \n \nIf they complain of the heaviness (of the revenue) or of diseases, \nor of scarcity of water, or of an excess of water, or of a change in the \ncondition of the land either due to flood or to drought..., you should remit \nthe revenue to the extent that you hope would improve their status. The \nremission granted by you for the removal of distress from them should not \nbe grudged by you because it is an investment which they will return to \nyou in the shape of the prosperity of your country and the progress of \nyour domain in addition to earning their praise and happiness for meting \nout justice to them. You can depend upon their strength because of the \ninvestment made by you in them through catering to their convenience \nand can have confidence in them because of the justice extended to them \nby being kind to them. After that, circumstances may so turn that you may \nhave a need for their assistance. It is then that they will bear it happily, for \nprosperity is capable of bearing whatever you load on it. The ruin of the \nland is caused by the poverty of the cultivators, while the cultivators \nbecome poor when the officers concentrate on the collection (of money), \nhaving little hope for continuance (in their posts) and deriving no benefit \nfrom warnings. \n5. The Clerical Establishment \nThen you should take care of your secretarial workers. Put the \nbest of them in charge of your affairs. Entrust those of your writings \nwhich contain your policies and secrets to him who possesses the best \ncharacter, who is not elated by honors lest he should dare speak against \nyou in public. He should also not be negligent in presenting the \ncommunications of your officers before you and issuing correct replies to \nthem on your behalf and in matters of your receipts and payments. He \nshould not make any damaging agreement on your behalf and should not \nfail in repudiating an agreement against you. He should not be ignorant of \nthe extent of his own status in matters because whoever is ignorant of his \nown status is (even) more ignorant of the status of others. \n \nYour selection of these people should not be on the basis of your \nunderstanding (of them), confidence and good impression because people \ncatch the ideas of the officers through affectation and personal service, \nand there is nothing in it which is like well-wishing or trustfulness. You \nshould rather test them by what they did under the virtuous people before \nyou. Take a decision in favor of one who has a good name among the \ncommon people and is the most renowned in trustworthiness because this \nwill be a proof of your regard for Allah and for him on whose behalf you \nhave been appointed to this status (namely your Imam). Establish one \nchief for every department of work. He should not be incapable of big \nmatters and a rush of work should not perplex him. Whenever there is a \ndefect in your secretaries which you overlook, then you will be held \nresponsible for it. \n6. Traders and Industrialists\nTake some advice about traders and industrialists. Give them \ngood counsel whether they are settled (shop-keepers) or traders or \nphysical laborers because they are the sources of profit and the means of \nthe provision of useful items. They bring them from distant and far-flung \nareas throughout the land and the sea, the plains or the mountains, from \nwhere people cannot come and to where they do not dare to go, for they \nare peaceful and there is no fear of rebellion from them and they are quite \nwithout fear of treason. \n \nLook after their affairs before those of your own wherever they \nmay be in your land. Be informed, along with this, that most of them are \nvery narrow-minded and awfully avaricious. They hoard goods for \nprofiteering and fixing high prices for goods. This is a source of harm to \nthe people and a blot on the officers in charge. Stop people from hoarding \nbecause the Messenger of Allah (k) has prohibited it. The sale should be \nsmooth, with correct weights and prices, not harmful to either party, the \nseller or the buyer; whoever commits hoarding after you prohibit it, give \nhim exemplary but not excessive punishment. \n7. The Lowest Class \n(Fear) Allah and keep Him in view with regard to the lower class \nwhich consists of those who have few means: the poor, the destitute, the \npenniless and the disabled because in this class are both the discontented \nand those who beg. Take care for the sake of Allah of His obligations \ntowards them for which He has made you responsible. Fix for them a \nshare from the public funds and a share from the crops of lands taken over \nas booty for Islam in every area because in it the remote ones have the \nsame shares as the near ones. All these people are those whose rights have \nbeen placed in your charge. Therefore, a luxurious life should not keep \nyou away from them. You cannot be excused for ignoring small matters \nsimply because you were deciding big ones. Consequently, do not be \nunmindful of them, nor should you turn your face away from them out of \nvanity. \n \nTake care of the affairs of those of them who do not approach you \nbecause they are of unsightly appearance or those whom people regard as \nlow. Appoint for them some trusted people who are God-fearing and \nhumble. They should inform you of these people’s conditions. Then deal \nwith them with a sense of responsibility to Allah on the Day you will \nmeet Him because of all the subjects these people are the most worthy of \nan equitable treatment, while for others also you should fulfil their rights \nso as to render account to Allah. \n \nTake care of the orphans and the aged who have no means (for \nlivelihood) nor are they ready for begging. This is heavy on the officers; \nin fact, every obligation is heavy. Allah lightens it for those who seek the \nnext world, so they endure (hardships) upon themselves and trust on the \ntruthfulness of Allah’s promise to them. And fix a time for complainants \nwherein you make yourself free for them and sit with them in common \naudience and feel humble for the sake of Allah Who created you. (On that \noccasion) you should keep away your army and assistants such as the \nguards and the police so that anyone who likes to speak may speak to you \nwithout fear because I have heard the Messenger of Allah say in more \nthan one place, “The people among whom the right of the weak is not \nsecured from the strong without fear will never achieve purity.” Tolerate \ntheir awkwardness and inability to speak. Keep away from you \nnarrowness and haughtiness; by the will of Allah, on this account spread \nover you the covers of His mercy and be optimistic of the reward of His \nobedience. Whatever you give, give it joyfully, but when you refuse, do it \nhandsomely and with apologies. \n \nThen there are certain matters which you cannot avoid \nperforming yourself. For example, relying on your officers when your \nsecretaries are unable to do so, or tending to the complaints of the people \nwhen your assistants refrain. Finish every day the work meant for it \nbecause every day has its own work. Keep for yourself the better and \ngreater portion of these periods for the worship of Allah, although all \nthese items are for Allah provided the intention is pure and the subjects \nprosper thereby. \nCommunion with Allah \nThe particular thing by which you should purify your religion for \nAllah should be the fulfillment of those obligations which are especially \nfor Him. Therefore, devote to Allah some of your physical activity during \nthe night and the day and whatever (worship) you perform for seeking \nnearness to Allah should be complete, without defect or deficiency, no \nmatter what physical exertion it may involve. When you lead the prayers \nfor the people, it should be neither (too long as to be) boring nor (too \nshort as to be) wasteful because among the people there are the sick as \nwell as those who have needs of their own. When the Messenger of Allah \n(k) sent me to Yemen, I inquired how I should pray with them and he \nreplied, “Say the prayers as the weakest of them will say, and be \nconsiderate of the believers. \nOn the Behavior and Action of a Ruler \nDo not stay secluded from the public for a long time because the \nseclusion of those in authority from the subjects is a norm of narrow-\nsightedness, and it causes ignorance of their affairs. Seclusion from them \nalso prevents them from the knowledge of those things which they need to \nknow. As a result, they begin to regard big matters as small and small \nmatters as big, good matters as bad and bad matters as good, while the \ntruth is confused with falsehood. After all, a governor is a human being \nand cannot have knowledge of things which people keep hidden from \nhim. \n \nNo writ is big on the face of truth to differentiate its various \nexpressions from falsehood. You can be one of two kinds of men: If you \nare generous in granting rights, why this hiding in spite of (your) \ndischarging the obligations and good deeds which you perform? Or you \nmay be a victim of miserliness. In that case, people will soon give up \nasking you since they will lose hope of a generous treatment from you. In \nspite of that, there are many needs of the people towards you which do \nnot involve any hardship on you, such as the complaint against oppression \nor the request for justice in a case. \n \nFurthermore, a governor has favorites and people of easy access \nto him. They misappropriate things. They are high-handed and do not \nobserve justice in matters. You should destroy the root of evil in the \npeople by cutting away the causes of these defects. Do not make any land \ngrants to your hangers-on or supporters. They should not expect from you \nthe possession of land which may cause harm to adjoining people over the \nquestion of irrigation or public services whose burden the grantees place \non others. In this way, the benefit will be rather theirs than yours and the \nblame will lie on you in this world as well as in the next. \n \nEffect equity to whomsoever it is due, whether near you or far \nfrom you. In this matter, you should be enduring and watchful even \nthough it may involve your relatives and favorites. Keep in view the \nreward of that which appears burdensome on you because its reward is \nsurely handsome. \n \nIf the subjects suspect you of high-handedness, explain to them \nyour status publicly and remove their suspicion with such an explanation \nbecause this will mean an exercise for your soul and a consideration for \nthe subjects while this explanation will secure your aim of keeping them \nfirm in the truth. \n \nDo not reject peace to which your enemy may invite you and \nwherein there is the pleasure of Allah because peace brings rest to your \narmy, relief from your worries and safety for your country. But after \npeace there is a great apprehension from the enemy because often the \nenemy offers peace in order to benefit from your negligence and \nrelaxation. Therefore, be cautious and do not act according to your \nwishful thinking in this regard. \n \nIf you conclude an agreement between yourself and your enemy \nor enter into a pledge, fulfil your agreement and carry out your pledge \nfaithfully. Place yourself as a shield against whatever you have pledged \nbecause among the obligations of Allah there is nothing on which people \nare more strongly united, despite the difference of their ideas and \nvariation of their views, than respect for fulfilling pledges. Besides \nMuslims, even unbelievers have abided by agreements because they \nrealized the dangers which will come in the wake of the violation thereof. \nTherefore, do not deceive your enemy because no one can offend Allah \nsave the ignorant and the wicked. Allah made His agreement and pledged \nthe sign of security which He has spread over His creatures through His \nmercy and an asylum in which they stay in His protection and seek the \nbenefit of nearness to Him. Hence, there should be no deception, cunning \nor duplicity in it. \n \nDo not enter into an agreement which may admit different \ninterpretations and do not change the interpretation of vague words after \nthe conclusion and confirmation (of the agreement). If an agreement of \nAllah involves you in hardship, do not seek its repudiation without \njustification because the bearing of hardships through which you expect \nrelief and a handsome result is better than a violation the consequence of \nwhich you fear, and that you fear you will be called upon by Allah to \naccount for it and you will not be able to seek forgiveness for it in this \nworld or in the next. \n \nYou should avoid shedding blood without justification because \nnothing invites the Divine retribution or is greater in (evil) consequences \nand more effective in the decline of prosperity and cutting short of life \nmore than the shedding of blood without a justification. On the Day of \nJudgement, Allah, the Glorified One, will commence giving His \njudgement among the people with regard to the cases of bloodshed \ncommitted by them. Do not, therefore, strengthen your authority by \nshedding prohibited blood because this will weaken and lower authority. \nIt moreover destroys it and shifts it elsewhere. You cannot offer any \nexcuse before Allah or before me for any wilful killing because there \nmust be the question of revenge in it. If you are involved in it be error and \nyou exceed in the use of your whip or sword or are harsh in inflicting \npunishment, as sometimes even a blow by the fist or a smaller stroke \ncauses death, then the pride in your authority should not prevent you from \npaying the blood money to the survivors of the killed person. \n \nYou should avoid self-admiration. Rely in what appears to be \ngood on yourself. Do not have any affinity for any exaggerated praise; it \nis one of the most reliable opportunities for Satan to obliterate the good \ndeeds of the virtuous. \n \nAvoid demonstrating (the weight of) your obligation to your \nsubjects for having done good to them or praising your own actions or \nmaking promises then breaking them. Demonstrating such an obligation \ndestroys goodness. Self-praise takes away the light of truth. Breaking \npromises earns the hatred of Allah and of the people. Allah, the Glorified \nOne, says the following: “Most hateful to Allah is that you say what you \ndo not do” (Holy Quran, 61: 3). \n \nAvoid haste in matters before their time. Slowness till their \nproper time, insistence on them when the propriety of action is not known \nor weakens when it becomes clear is preferable. Assign to every matter its \nproper place and do every job at its appropriate time. \n \nDo not appropriate to yourself that in which the people have an \nequal share, nor should you be indifferent of matters which have come to \nlight with the excuse that you are accountable for others. Shortly, the \ncurtains of all matters will be raised from your vision and you will be \nrequired to render redress to the oppressed. Have control over (your) \nsense of prestige. Beware of any outburst of anger, the might of your arm \nand the sharpness of your tongue. Guard yourself against all these by \navoiding haste and by delaying severe measures till your anger subsides \nand till you gain your self-control. You cannot withhold yourself from \nthis unless you bear in mind that you have to return to Allah. \n \nIt is necessary for you to recall how matters went with those who \npreceded you, be it those of a government, or a great tradition, or a \nprecedent of our Prophet (h), or the obligatory commands contained in \nthe Book of Allah. You should follow them as you have seen us acting \nupon them and should exert yourself in following what I have enjoined \nyou to follow in this document wherein I have exhausted my pleas to you. \nIf your heart advances towards its passions, you may have no plea in its \nsupport.\n \nI ask Allah through the extent of His mercy and the greatness of \nHis power of giving to grant me a good inclination, that He may prompt \nme and you own selves to present a clear plea before Him and before His \ncreatures in a manner that may attract His pleasure along with handsome \npraise among the people, good effect in the country, an increase in \nprosperity and a heightening of honor, and that He may allow me and you \nown selves to die a death of virtue and martyrdom. Surely, we have to \nreturn to Him. Peace be on the Messenger of Allah (k), and that is the \nend of the matter. \n \nThis document, which deserves to be called the constitution of the \nIslamic policy, was prepared by the person who was the greatest scholar \nof the Divine Law and who acted upon it more than anyone else. From \nstudying Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s way of governance as recorded on \nthese pages, it can be concluded that his aim was only to enforce the \nDivine Law and the improvement of social conditions , not to disrupt \npublic security or to fill treasures by plunder, or to strive to extend the \ncountry’s boundaries by fair or foul means. Worldly governments \ngenerally adopt such constitutions which cater to their utmost benefit and \ntry to change every law which is against that aim or jeopardizes their \nobjective. Every article of this constitution serves as a custodian of \ncommon interests and protects collective organization. Its enforcement \nhas no impact over selfishness; there is no iota of self-interest in it. It \ncontains such basic principles for the fulfillment of Allah’s obligations, \nthe protection of human rights without distinction of religion or \ncommunity, care for the destitute, the poor, the provision of succor to the \nlow and the down-trodden. From it, full guidance can be earned for the \npropagation of righteousness and justice, the establishment of peace and \nsecurity, and the prosperity and well-being of the people. \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) wrote this instrument for Malik ibn \nal-Harith al-Ashtar when the latter was appointed as the Governor of \nEgypt in 38 A.H./658 A.D. Malik al-Ashtar was one of the chief \ncompanions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). He had shown great \nendurance, steadfastness, perfect confidence and trust in Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x). He had attained the utmost nearness and attachment to him \nby molding his conduct and character after those of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x). This can be gauged by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s words: \n“Malik was to me as I was to the Messenger of Allah (k)” (Ibn Abul-\nHadid, Vol. 15, p. 98; Al-A`lam, Vol. 6, p. 131). Malik al-Ashtar, too, \nproved all of this through his selfless attitude towards his service, took a \nvery active part in military encounters and proved himself to be Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib’s right arm in all battles and encounters. He showed such \nfeats of courage and daring that his bravery was acknowledged \nthroughout Arabia. Along with this bravery he was also conspicuous in \nendurance and forbearing. In this regard, Warram ibn Abu Firas an-\nNakh`i has written that once Malik was passing through the market of \nKufa wearing an outfit and turban made of gunny-cloth when a \nshopkeeper, finding him in this condition and wearing such clothes, threw \nsome rotten leaves on him, but he did not at all mind this dirty behavior, \nnor did he even look at him. Rather, he quietly stepped forward. Then \nsomeone said to that shopkeeper, “Do you know to whom you have been \nso insolent?” He replied that he did not know who he was, whereupon he \nwas told that it was Malik al-Ashtar, companion of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x). Hearing this, the shopkeeper almost lost his wits and at once \nran behind Malik him to ask for his forgiveness for this insolence and \nhumiliating treatment. In his search, he reached a mosque where Malik \nwas offering prayers. When he finished the prayers, this man went \nforward and fell on Malik’s feet and begged for his pardon with great \npertinacity and weeping. Malik raised the man’s chin up and said, “By \nAllah, I have come to the mosque to pray to Allah to forgive you. I myself \nhad pardoned you that very moment and I hope Allah, too, will pardon \nyou” (Tanbihul-Khawatir wa Nuzhatul-Nawazir, Vol. 1, p. 2; Bihar al-\nAnwar, Vol. 42, p. 157). Such is the forgiveness and tolerance of a \nwarrior at the mention of whose name courage itself trembled and whose \nswordsmanship was acknowledged by the brave men of Arabia. And such \nis the real sign of bravery: A man should exercise self-control during the \nbitterness of anger and moment of outrage and endure hardships with \npatience and calmness. In this regard, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s saying is \nthat, “The most brave of men is one who over-powers his own passions.” \n \nHowever, besides these characteristics and qualities, he had a \nperfect aptitude for organization and administration. Thus, when the \nOthmani (al-Othmaniyyah) party began to spread the germs of destruction \nin Egypt and tried to upset the law and order of the country by mischief \nand rebellion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) removed Muhammad ibn Abu \nBakr from his post as the Governor of the country and decided to appoint \nMalik al-Ashtar in his place, although at that time Malik was also posted \nas the Governor of Nasibin. However, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent \nhim word that he should name someone as his deputy and come to Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x). Upon receipt of this order, Malik al-Ashtar \nappointed Shabib ibn Amir al-Azdi in his place and he himself went to \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) gave him his \nwritten appointment and sent him off to Egypt and also sent a separate \nwritten order to the Egyptians to obey him. When Mu`awiyah got the \nnews of Malik al-Ashtar’s appointment through his spies, he was upset \nbecause he had promised Amr ibn al-As that he would make him the \ngovernor of Egypt in reward for his services. He had hoped that Amr ibn \nal-As would easily defeat Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr and wrest the power \nfrom him, but he now could not imagine conquering Egypt by defeating \nMalik al-Ashtar. He, therefore, decided to do away with him before he \ntook over the charge. For this, he arranged with a landlord of the city of \nal-Arish (or al-Qulzumm) that when Malik passed through Al-Arish on \nhis way to Egypt, he should kill him by some device or other and in \nreward for this the tax revenue of his estate would be written off. So, \nwhen Malik al-Ashtar reached al-Arish with retinue and force, the chief of \nal-Arish stood up in respect for him and insisted on having Malik as his \nown guest. Malik agreed and stayed at his place. When he finished the \nmeal, the host gave him some syrup of honey to drink in which he had \nadded some poison. Soon after drinking it, the poison began to show its \neffect and before the eyes of everyone, this great warrior known for his \nswordsmanship and for putting the rows of the enemy to fight calmly \nsurrendered to death. \n \nWhen Mu`awiyah received the news of the success of this plot, he \nwas overjoyed and shouted in merriment, “O, honey is also an army of \nAllah!” Then, in a speech, he said, “Ali ibn Abu Talib had two right hand \nmen. One was chopped off on the day of Siffin: that was Ammar ibn \nYasir, and the second has been severed now: he is Malik al-Ashtar.” \n \nWhen the news of Malik’s assassination reached Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x), he was very grieved and sorrowful. He said the following: \n“Malik! Who is Malik?! If Malik was a stone, he was hard and solid; if he \nwas a rock, he was a great rock which had no parallel. It seems his death \nhas made me also lifeless. I swear by Allah that his death made the \nSyrians joyous and insulted the Iraqis.” Then he continued to say: \n“Women have become too barren to give birth to a man like Malik...” (al-\nTabari, Vol. 1, pp. 3392-3395; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, pp. 352-353; al-\nYa`qubi, Vol. 2, p. 194; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1366; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. \n6, pp. 74-77; Ibn Kathir, Vol. 7, pp. 313-314; Abul-Fida’, Vol. 1, p. 179)."

    "text": "To Talhah and az-Zubayr (through Imran ibn al-Hussain al-\nKhuza’i1). AbÅ Ja`far al-Iskafi has mentioned this in his “Kitab al-\nMaqamat on the excellent qualities (manaqib) of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x).”\nYou both know, though you conceal it, that I did not approach the \npeople before they approached me, and I did not ask them to swear the \noath of allegiance to me till they themselves swore the oath of allegiance \nto me. You both were among those who approached me and swore the \noath of allegiance to me. Certainly the common people did not swear the \noath of allegiance under any force or for any money given to them. If you \ntwo swore allegiance to me obediently, come back and offer repentance to \nAllah soon. But if you swore allegiance to me reluctantly, you have \ncertainly given me cause for action by showing your obedience and \n \n214Imra n ibn al-Hussain al-Khuza’i was a high ranking companion [of \nImam Ali (x)] who was distinguished for his learning and achievements. He was \nvery cautious in relating traditions. He accepted Islam in the year of the Battle of \nKhaybar and participated in jihad with the Prophet (h). He was honored by the \njudicial status in Kufa and died in Basra in 52 A.H. One of the authentic \ntraditions related by Imra n ibn al-Hussain about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) is \nthis: The Messenger of Allah raised and sent an army under the command of Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x). From the khums (one-fifth) received by him, “Ali set aside a \nslave girl for himself. This was seen as distasteful by some of his men and four \nof them decided to complain of it to the Prophet (h). On their return, they \napproached the Prophet (h) and one of them stood up and said the following: O \nMessenger of Allah! Do you not see that Ali (x) did such-and-such?’ The \nProphet (h) turned his face away from him. Another man stood up and made \nthe same complaint and the Prophet (h) turned his face away from him, too. \nStill another man stood up and repeated what his two colleagues had said and \nmet the same reaction. Then the fourth man stood up and spoke like his \npredecessors. The Prophet (h) finally turned to them with signs of anger on his \nface and said the following: `What do you want me to do to Ali? (repeating it \nthrice). Surely Ali is from me and I am from him and after me he is the master \nof all the believers’” (Jami’al-Sihah, al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, p. 632; Al-Musnad,\nAhmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 4, pp. 437-438; Al-Musnad, Abu Dawud at-Tayalisi, p. \n111; Al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, Vol. 3, pp. 110-111; Hilyat al-Awliya’, Abu \nNu’aym, Vol. 6, p. 294; Tarikh al-Islam, al-Dhahbi, Vol. 2, p. 196; Tarikh, Ibn \nKathir, Vol. 7, p. 345; Usd al-Ghaba, Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 4, p. 27, Al-Isaba, Ibn \nHajar, Vol. 2, p. 509). \nconcealing your disobedience215 By my life, you were not more entitled \nthan other Muhajirun to conceal and hide the matter. Your refusal to \nswear the oath of allegiance before actually doing so would have been \neasier than getting out of it after having already accepted it. \n \nYou have indicated that I killed Othman; then let someone from \namong the people of Medina who supported neither me nor you decide \nthe matter between me and yourself. One of us shall face(the command of \nlaw) according to (one’s) involvement. You should give up your way \nnow, when the great question before you is only one of shame, before you \nface the question of shame coupled with the fire of Hell, and that is the \nend of the matter."

    "text": "To the People of Egypt Sent Through Malik al-Ashtar When \nHe Was Made Governor \n Allah, the Glorified One, deputed Muhammad (h) as a warner \nfor all the worlds and a witness for all the prophets. When the Prophet \n(h) expired, the Muslims quarrelled about power after him. By Allah, it \nnever occurred to me and I never imagined that after the Prophet (h) the \nArabs would snatch away the caliphate from his Ahlul-Bayt (x), nor that \nthey would take it away from me after him, but I suddenly noticed how \npeople surrounded the man to swear the oath of allegiance to him.216\n \nI, therefore, withheld my hand till I saw that many people were \nreverting from Islam and trying to destroy the religion of Muhammad \n(h). I then feared that if I did not protect Islam and its people, and if \nthere occurred in it a breach or destruction, it would mean a greater blow \nto me than the loss of power over you which was, in any case, to last for a \nfew days of which everything would pass away as the mirage passes \naway, or as the cloud scuds away. Therefore, in these eventualities, I rose \ntill wrong was destroyed and disappeared and religion attained peace and \nsafety. \n \n216The Prophet’s declarations about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) such \nas: “This is my brother, my vicegerent and my caliph among you,” and while \nreturning from his farewell hajj at Ghadir Khum, that “For whosoever I am the \nmaster, Ali is his master” had already settled the issue of the Prophet’s \nreplacement and succession. Besides them, there was no further need at all for \nany new “election”, nor could it be imagined that the people of Medna would \nfeel the need for an “election” after Allah had already elected a man to succeed \nHis Prophet (k). But some power-hungry individuals ignored these clear \ninjunctions as if their ears had never been acquainted with them and considered \nthe election so necessary that, forgetting completely about performing the burial \nrites for the Prophet (h), they assembled at the saqifa of Banu Sa`idah and \n“elected” Abu Bakr as caliph without the slightest show of a democratic process. \nThis was a very critical moment for Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). On one hand, \nsome interested individuals declared that he should take up arms and, on the \nother hand, he noticed that those Arabs who had accepted Islam by dint of its \nmilitary might were leaving it and Musaylimah ibn Thumamah al-Hanafi, the \nLiar (al-Kaththab), and Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid al-Asadi (the Liar) were \nthrowing tribe after tribe into misguidance. In these circumstances, had there \nbeen a civil war and Muslims had fought against Muslims, the forces of heresy \nand hypocrisy would have joined together and swept Islam off the surface of the \nearth. Therefore, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) preferred to keep quiet rather than \nto fight and, with the purpose of maintaining the solidarity of Islam, confined \nhimself to peacefully protesting rather than taking up arms. This was because \nformal power was not so dear to him as the good and prosperity of the \ncommunity. For stopping the machinations of the hypocrites and defeating the \naims of the mischief mongers, there was no other course but that he should not \nfan the flames of war by giving up his own claim. This was such a big deed for \nthe preservation of Islamic policy that it is acknowledged by all the sects of \nIslam. \nAn excerpt from the same letter: \n \nBy Allah, if I had encountered them alone and they had been so \nnumerous as to fill earth to the brim, I will not have worried or become \nperplexed. I am clear in myself and possess conviction from Allah about \ntheir misguidance and my guidance. I am hopeful and expectant that I will \nmeet Allah and get His good reward. But I am worried that foolish and \nwicked people will control the affairs of the entire community. The result: \nThey will grab the funds of Allah as their own property and make His \npeople slaves,217 fight with the virtuous and ally with the sinful. Indeed, \nthere is among them whoever drank (wine) unlawfully218 and was \n \n2172. This refers to the saying of the Holy Prophet (h) about the \nchildren of Umayyah and the children of Abul-As ibn Umayyah (grandfather of \nOthman ibn Affan and ancestor of the dynasty of Marwan’s caliphs), as related \nby Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, that the Holy Prophet (h) said the following: “When \nthe number of Banu Umayyah reaches forty men, they will make Allah’s people \ntheir slaves, grab Allah’s funds as their own property and render the Book of \nAllah a cause of corruption” (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 4, p. 479; Kanz al-Ummal,\nVol. 11, p. 149). About the children of Abul-As it is related by Abu Dharr, Abu \nSa’id al-Khudri, Ibn Abbas, Abu Hurayra and others that the Holy Prophet (h)\nsaid the following: “When the number of Banu Abul-As reaches thirty men, they \nwill grab the funds of Allah as their own property, make Allah’s people their \nslaves and render the religion of Allah a cause of corruption” (Al-Musnad,\nAhmed ibn Hanbal, Vol. 3, p. 80; Al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, Vol. 4, p. 480; Al-\nMatalib al-Aliyah, Ibn Hajar, Vol. 4, p. 332; Majma’az-Zawa’id, al-Haythami, \nVol. 5, pp. 241, 243; Kanz al-Ummal, al-Muttaqi al-Hindi, Vol. 11, pp. 148, \n149, 351, 354). The history of Islam (after the death of the Holy Prophet [h]) \ncontains sufficient testimony to prove this prediction of the Holy Prophet (h). \nThe fear of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) for the Muslim community was based \non it. \n2183. The man who drank wine was al-Walid ibn Uqbah ibn Abu \nMu’ayt. He was born by the same mother as that of caliph Othman and of his \nGovernor of Kufa. Al-Walid, on an occasion, in a state of intoxication, led the \nmorning prayers in the central mosque of Kufa with four raka’at instead of the \nusual two as prescribed by the Holy Prophet (h). The congregation, which \nconsisted of several pious persons like ibn Mas`Åd, was outraged and felt further \nirritated when, finishing the four raka’at, al-Walid said the following: “What a \npleasant morning?! I would like to extend the prayers. Furthermore, if you \nconsent, repeated complaints had already been made to the caliph against al-\nWalid on account of his debauchery, but as often dismissed.” People now \nreproached Othman for not listening to their grievances and favoring such a \nscoundrel. By chance, they succeeded in taking off the signet ring from the hand \nof the Governor as he lay unconscious from the effects of an act of his \nwhipped by way of punishment fixed by Islam and there is whoever did \nnot accept Islam till he had secured financial gain through it.219 If this had \nnot been so, I would not have emphasized gathering you, reprimanding \nyou, mobilizing you and urging you (for jihad), but if you refuse and \nshow weakness, I will leave you. \n \nDo you not see that the boundaries of your cities have diminished, \nyour populated areas have been conquered, your possessions have been \nsnatched away and your cities and lands have been assaulted? May Allah \nhave mercy on you, get up to fight your enemy and do not remain \nconfined to the ground; otherwise, you will face oppression and suffer \nignominy and your fate will be the worst. The warrior should be wakeful \nbecause if he sleeps, the enemy does not sleep, and that is the end of the \nmatter."

So, when my messenger reaches you, \n \ndebauchery. It was carried off to Medina. Still, the caliph was too slow and \nhesitated to enforce the punishment on his Governor (his half brother); giving \ncause to be himself reproachfully accused of ignoring the law, although at last \nhe was persuaded to have al-Walid whipped forty lashes. He was consequently \ndeposed from his office. Sa’id ibn al-As, a cousin of Othman was appointed to \ntake his place, and this was a matter of a great reproach against Othman” (Ansab \nal-Ashraf, al-Baladhiri, Vol. 5, pp. 33-35; Al-Aghani, Abul-Faraj al-Isfahani, \nVol. 4, pp. 174-187; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 4, pp. 1554-1557; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 5, \npp. 91-92; al-Tabari, Vol. 1, pp. 2843-2850; Ibn al-Athir, Vol. 3, pp. 105-107; \nIbn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 17, pp. 227-245). \n219The man who accepted Islam only after securing financial gain was \nMu`awiyah who did so only for worldly benefits.\n2201. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had the idea of suppressing the \nrebellion of the people of Basra, he sent this letter through Imam al-Hassan (x)\nto Abu Musa (Abdullah ibn Qays) al-Ash`ari, who had been appointed Governor \nof Kufa by Othman. In it, the Imam (x) scolds him for his duplicity and self-\nprepare yourself and get ready, come out of your den and call upon those \nwho are with you. Then, if you are convinced of the truth, get up. But if \nyou feel cowardly, go away. By Allah, you will be caught wherever you \nmay be and you will not be spared till you are completely upset and \neverything about you is scattered and till you are shaken from your seat. \nThen, you will fear from your front as you do from the rear. \n \nWhat you hope for is not a light matter; it is a serious calamity. \nWe have to ride its camels, overcome its difficulties and level its \nmountains. Set your mind in order, take a grip on your affairs and acquire \nyour (lot and your) share. If you do not like it, go away to where neither \nyou are welcome nor can you escape. It is better that you be left alone and \nlie sleeping. Then no one will inquire where is so-and-so.

    "text": "Replying to Mu`awiyah.\nCertainly, we and you were on amicable terms, as you mentioned, \nbut differences arose between us and your own self the other day when \nwe accepted belief (iman)while you rejected it. Today, the status is that \nwe are steadfast (in our belief) but you are creating mischief. Those of \nyou who accepted Islam did so reluctantly and that, too, took place when \nall the chief men had accepted Islam and joined the Messenger of Allah \n(may Allah bless him and his descendants). \n \ncontradictory behavior. He also attempted to persuade him to carry out jihad\nbecause on one hand, he used to say that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was the \ntrue Imam and allegiance to him was right while, on the other, he said that to \nsupport him in fighting against the Muslims was not right, that it was a mischief \nand it was necessary to keep off this mischief. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nhas referred to this contradictory view with the words “huwa laka wa’alayka” \n(which go in your favor as well as against you). The intention is that when Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) is the rightful Imam, how can fighting his enemy in his \nown company be wrong? And if fighting on his side is wrong, then what is the \nmeaning of saying that he is the rightful Imam? In any case, in spite of his \nreluctance to fight, the people of Kufa came out in large numbers to join Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib’s army and fully participated in the battle, giving such a \ndefeat to the people of Basra that the latter never again dared to rebellion \nthereafter.\nYou have stated that I killed Talhah and az-Zubayr, forced Aisha \nout of her house and adopted residence between the two cities (Kufa and \nBasra). These matters are none of your concern, nor do they involve \nanything against you. Therefore, no explanation about them is due to you. \n \nYou also state that you are coming to me with a party of \nMuhajirun and Ansar, but hijra came to an end on the day your brother \nwas taken prisoner. If you are in a hurry, then wait a bit as I may come to \nmeet you and that will be more befitting as it will mean that Allah has \nappointed me to punish you. But if you come to me, it will be just as the \npoet of Banu Asad said: “They are advancing against summer winds \nwhich are hurling stones on them in the highlands and in the lowlands.” \n \n(Remember that) I still have the sword with which I dispatched \nyour grandfather, mother’s brother and brother to one and the same place \n(Hell). By Allah, I know what you are! Your heart is sheathed and your \nintelligence is weak. It is better to say that you have ascended to where \nyou view a bad scene which is against you, not in your favor, because you \nare searching a thing lost by someone else, you are tending someone \nelse’s cattle and you are hankering after a thing which is not yours nor \nhave you any attachment to it. How remote your words are from your \nactions, and how closely you resemble your paternal and maternal uncles \nwho were led by their wickedness and love for wrong to oppose \nMuhammad (h), consequently, they were killed as you know. They \ncould not put up a defense against the calamity and could not protect their \n“safe haven” from the striking of swords which abound in the battle and \nwhich do not show weakness. \n \nYou have said a lot about the killing of Othman. You must first \njoin what the people have joined (i.e. allegiance) then seek a verdict about \n(the accused people) from me and I shall settle the matter between you \nand them according to the Book of Allah, the Sublime. But what you are \naiming at is just the fake nipple given to a child in the first days of \nweaning. Peace be on those who deserve it. \n \nMu`awiyah had written a letter to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in \nwhich he, having recalled mutual unity and amicability, laid on him the \nblame of killing Talhah and az-Zubayr and getting Aisha out of her house \nwith the objective to adopt Kufa as his seat of government in place of \nMedina. In the end, he made a threat of war, saying that he was about to \ncome out with a force of Muhajirun and Ansar to fight. Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) wrote this letter in reply to him wherein he commented about \nMu`awiyah’s claim for unity. He meant to say the following: “There \nmight have been unity between you and us, but with the advent of Islam, \nsuch a huge gap has developed between both of us that it is not possible to \nbridge it and such a separation has occurred which cannot be rejoined. \nThe reason for all of this is that we responded to the call of the Prophet \n(h) and hastened towards Islam while you were still an unbeliever and \nliving in ignorance, hence, we and you came to adopt separate ways. But \nwhen Islam secured stability and the chief of Arabs entered its fold, you, \ntoo, felt obliged to do so [with the threat of otherwise losing your life]. \nYou secured protection of your lives by pretending to accept Islam, but \nyou continued secretly to fan the mischief intended to shatter Islam’s \nfoundations. Since we had accepted Islam of our own free will and \npleasure, we adhered to the right path. At no stage did any faltering occur \nin our steadfastness. Therefore, your acceptance of Islam could not make \nus agree with your views.” \n \nAs regarding Mu`awiyah’s accusation that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) engineered the killing of Talhah and az-Zubayr, even if this \nblame is admitted as true, is it not a fact that they had both openly \nrevolted against Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and had risen for war after \nbreaking their oath of allegiance to him? Therefore, if they were killed \nwith regard to their rebellion, their blood would be wasted, and no blame \nwould lie on the killer because the penalty for whoever rebellions against \nthe rightful Imam is death and fighting against him is permissible, without \nany doubt. The fact, however, is that this accusation is baseless because \nTalhah was killed by a man from his own party. Thus, the historians \nwrite: Marwan ibn al-Hakam shot Talhah with an arrow and, turning to \nAban ibn Othman, said the following: “We have killed a killer of your \nfather and relieved you of revenge” (Ibn Sa`d, Vol. 3, part 1, p. 159; Ibn \nAl-Athir Vol. 3, p. 244; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 2, pp. 766-769; Usd al-Ghaba, \nVol. 3, pp. 60, 61; Al-Isaba, Vol. 2, p. 230; Tahthib al-Tahthib, Vol. 5, p. \n21).\n \nAs for az-Zubayr, he was killed by Amr ibn Jurmuz as he was on \nhis way back from Basra and there was no hand of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) in it. Similarly, Aisha herself came out of her house as the head \nof this rebellious group while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) advised her \nseveral times to realize her status and not to step out of her bounds, but \nthese suggestions had no effect on her. \nOf the same note was his criticism that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) left Medina and adopted Kufa as the seat of his government because \nMedina turned out bad people and threw away dirt. The reply to this is \nonly that Mu`awiyah himself always retained Damascus as his capital, \nalways staying away from Medina. \n \nIn this way, what right can he have to object to Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) changing his seat of government? Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nleft Medina because of those rebellions which had cropped up from all \ndirections. In order to suppress them, only the selection of such a place as \na capital, from where military assistance could be mobilized at any time, \ncould be useful. Thus, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) had seen on the \noccasion of the Battle of Jamal that a great majority of the people of Kufa \nhad supported him. By making it a base for the army, the defense of the \nImam (x) against the enemy could be easily managed, while Medina was \nnot appropriate for military mobilization, supplies or reinforcements. \n \nFinally, as for Mu`awiyah’s threat that he will march with the \nMuhajirun and the Ansar, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) replied to this point \nin a very subtle way: “How will you bring the Muhajirun now since the \ndoor for hijra was closed when your brother, Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan, was \ntaken prisoner?” This man was taken prisoner on the day of the fall of \nMecca. There is no question of hijra after the fall of Mecca so as to enable \nanyone to be called a muhajir because of the Prophet’s saying: “There is \nno hijra after the victory over Mecca.”"

In \nreply, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) wrote this letter in which he has tried to draw \nMu`awiyah’s attention to the clear facts about this very battle of the Kharijites \nbecause this battle took place in accordance with the prediction of the Prophet \n(h) while Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) himself had said before the battle that \nbesides the people of Jamal and Siffin, he had to fight against one more group \nand they were the “deviators” from the religion, namely the Kharijites. The \nyour forefathers of making wrong claims, spreading false and untrue \nnotions, claiming for yourself what is far above you and demanding what \nis not meant for you: You want to run away from what is right and to \nrebellion against what is more fastened to your flesh and blood, namely \nwhat has been heard by the depth of your ears and has filled your chest. \nAfter forsaking right, nothing remains except clear misguidance, and after \ndisregarding a (clear) statement, there is nothing left but confusion. You \nshould, therefore, guard (yourself) against doubts and the ill-effects of \nconfusion because for a long time, mischief has spread its veils and its \ngloom has blinded your eyes. \n \nI have received your letter which is full of uncouth utterances: \nThey weaken the cause of peace. It also is full of nonsensical expressions \nwhich have not been prepared with knowledge and forbearance. By \nreason of these things, you have become like one who is sinking in a \nmarshy land or groping in a dark place. You have raised yourself to a \nstatus which is difficult to approach and is devoid of any signs (of \nguidance). Even the royal kite cannot reach it. It is parallel to the Ayyuq \n(the star Capella), in loftiness. \n \nMay Allah forbid that you should be in charge of people’s affairs \nafter my assuming authority as caliph, or that I should issue an edict or \ndocument granting you authority over any of them. Therefore, from now \non, you should guard yourself and be watchful because if you recalcitrate \ntill the people of Allah (are forced to) rush upon you, then matters will be \n \noccurrence of this battle and the killing of the man with breasts (Dhul-\nThudayya) was a clear proof of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) being on the right \ntrack. If Mu`awiyah had not been obsessed with self-praise and lust for \nconquests, and had he not shut his eyes against what is right, as was the case \nwith his forefather, Abun Sufyan, and his brother, Utbah, he would have seen \nright and joined its tracks. But compelled by his natural inclinations, he always \nevaded what is right and shunned the truth, keeping himself blind to those \nsayings of the Prophet (h) which threw light on Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s \nImamate and vicegerency. Because of being with the Prophet (h) in the \nfarewell pilgrimage, the Prophet’s saying: “Of whomsoever I am the master, Ali \nis his master” was not hidden from him. Neither was the Prophet’s saying that: \n“O Ali! You are to me as Harun was to Musa” because of his presence during \nthe battle of Tabuk. In spite of all this, Mu`awiyah spent all his life concealing \nright and encouraging wrong. This was not due to any misunderstanding; rather, \nit was his own lust for power. This is what kept him busy prompting himself \nthrough means of suppression, trampling on the truth and violating justice, and \nthus do some people behave. \nclosed for you and whatever can be accepted from you today will not be \naccepted then, and that is the end of the matter."

They will not \nsell it for any price nor accept any alternative for it. They will join hands \nagainst anyone who opposes it and abandons it. They will help one \nanother. Their voice will be one. They will not break their pledge on \naccount of the rebuke of one who rebukes, or of the wrath of an angry \nperson, or the humiliating treatment of one group to the other, or the use \nof abusive terms by one party against the other."

    "text": "To the Army Officers When Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib (x)\nWhat ruined those (nations) before you was that they denied \npeople their rights, then they had to purchase them (with bribes), and they \nled the people to wrongdoing, and the latter followed their lead. \nBecame Caliph:\nPart Ten \nSelections\nFrom the Sayings and Sermons of Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib \n(x) Including His Replies to Questions and Maxims Made for Various \nPurposes\n \n1. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: During civil \ndisturbance be like an adolescent camel who has neither a back strong \nenough for riding nor udders for milking. \n \n“Labun” [which exists in the original Arabic text] means a “milch \ncamel” and “ibnul-labun” means its two-year old young. In this age, the \nyoung is neither suitable for riding nor does it has udders which could be \nmilked. It is called “ibnul-labun” because in this period of two years its \nmother bears another young and begins yielding milk again. \n \nThe intention is that during a civil disturbance or trouble, a man \nshould behave in such a manner that he may be regarded of no \nconsequence and is thus ignored. No need should be felt for his \nparticipation in either contending party. This is so because during \nmischief making, only dissociation can save one from being assaulted. Of \ncourse, when the clash is between right and wrong, it is not permissible to \nkeep aloof, nor can it be called civil disturbance. But on such occasions, it \nis obligatory to rise up to support what is right and suppress what is \nwrong. For example, during the battles of Jamal and Siffn, it was \nobligatory to support the right and to fight against the wrong. \n \n2. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Whoever \nadopts greed as a habit devalues himself; whoever discloses his hardship \nagrees to be humiliated, and whoever allows his tongue to overpower his \nsoul debases the soul. \n \n3. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Miserliness is a \nshame; cowardice is a defect; poverty disables an intelligent man from \narguing his case, and a destitute person is a stranger in his own home \ntown.\n \n4. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Incapability is \na catastrophe; endurance is bravery; abstinence is a wealth; self-restraint \nis a shield (against sinning), and the best company is submission (to \nAllah’s will). \n \n5. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Knowledge is a \nvenerable estate; good manners are new outfits, and thinking is a clear \nmirror.\n \n6. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The bosom of \nthe wise is the safe of his secrets; cheerfulness is the bond of friendship; \neffective forbearance is the grave of shortcomings. \n \nIt is narrated that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following \nin order to explain this meaning: Mutual reconciliation is the covering for \nshortcomings, and whoever admires himself attracts many opponents \nagainst him.222\n \n7. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Charity is an \neffective cure, and the actions of people in their present life will be before \ntheir eyes in the next.\n \nThis saying incorporates two phrases: \n \nThe first sentence relates to charity, and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) describes it as an effective cure. This is so because when a man helps \nthe poor and the destitute with alms, they pray for his health and recovery \nfrom the depth of their hearts and, therefore, their prayer is granted and it \nbrings him a cure. In this regard, there is the saying of the Holy Prophet \n(h) that, “Cure your sick with charity.” \n \nThe second sentence relates to the disclosure of actions on the \nDay of Judgement, namely that the good and the bad deeds which a \nperson performs in this world cannot be perceived by human senses \nbecause of the veil of material elements, but on the Day of Judgement, \nwhen material curtains will be lifted, they will so appear before the eyes \n \n222In the last phrase, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) describes the \nconsequences and effects resulting from self-admiration, namely that it creates \nhatred by and humiliation of others. Thus, the man who demonstrates his \n“greatness” by every pretext in order to make himself conspicuous is never \nregarded with esteem. People despise him because of his mental condition in \nseeking self-elevation. They are not prepared to accord him the worth which he \nclaims to have. They regard him much less than what he regards him. \nthat there will be no possibility of denial by anyone. Thus, Allah has said \nthe following: “On that Day, people shall come out (of their graves) in \n(scattered) groups to be shown their own deeds. Then whoever has done \nan atom-weight of good shall see it. And whoever has done an atom-\nweight of evil shall see it” (Holy Quran, 99: 6-8). \n \n8. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: How wonderful \nis man: He speaks with fat, talks with a piece of flesh, hears with a bone \nand breathes through a hole! \n \n9. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: When this \nworld advances towards anyone (with its riches), it attributes to him the \ngood of others, and when it turns away from him, it deprives him of his \nown good.223\n \nThey are friends of him whom the world favors \n \nAnd they are foes of him whom the world hits. \n \n10. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Deal with \npeople in such a manner that if you die, they should weep for you, and if \nyou live they should long for you.224\n \n11. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: When you \ngain power over your adversary, pardon him as your way of expressing \nthanks [to Allah] for being able to overpower him.225\n \n223The meaning is that when a man’s fortune is helpful and the world is \nfavorable to him, people will describe his performances with exaggeration and \ngive credit to him for the actions of others. But if a man loses the favor of the \nworld and the clouds of ill-luck and misfortune engulf him, people ignore his \nvirtues and do not at all tolerate even to recall his name. \n224To the person who behaves with others with benignity and \nmannerliness, people extend their hand of cooperation. They honor and respect \nhim and shed tears when he dies. Therefore, a person should lead such an \nagreeable life that no one should have any complaint against him, nor should \nany harm be caused by him to anyone so that during his life-time, he should \nattract others, and after his death, too, he should be well remembered. \n225The occasion for pardoning and forgiving is when there is power to \ntake revenge. But when there is no such power, pardon is just the result of \nhelplessness for which there is no credit. However, to practice pardon despite \nhaving power and ability to avenge is the essence of human distinction and an \nexpression of thanks to Allah for bestowing such power. The feeling of \n12. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The most helpless of all \nmen is whoever cannot find a few brothers during his life, but still more \nhelpless is whoever finds such a brother but loses him.226\n \n13. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: When you get \n(only) small favors, do not push them away by being ungrateful. \n \n14. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Whoever is \nabandoned by near ones is dear to remote ones. \n \n15. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Every \nmischief monger cannot even be reproved..227 \n \n16. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: All matters \nare subject to destiny, so much so that sometimes death results from \neffort.\n \n17. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked to explain the saying \nof the Messenger of Allah that: “Banish your old age (by hair-dye) and do \nnot acquire resemblance to the Jews.” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nreplied: The Prophet (h) said this at a time when the religion was \n \ngratefulness necessitates. It is then that man should bow down to Allah in \nhumbleness and humility by which the delicate feeling of pity and kindness will \nrise in his heart. The rising flames of rage and anger will cool down after. \nThereafter, there will be no urge to take revenge under the effect of which he \nwill use his power and ability to satisfy his anger instead of using it properly.\n226It is not difficult to attract others with good manners and cheerfulness and to \nbefriend them by sweet speech because. No physical exertion or mental worry is \nrequired for this. Having made friends, it is still easier to maintain the friendship \nand good relationships because for making real friends, some effort is needed, \nwhile for maintaining friendship, no difficulty is unsurmountable. Therefore, no \none can be more wretched than one who cannot even retain a thing which could \nbe retained just by keeping away from frowning. The idea here is that a man \nshould meet everyone with good manners and cheerfulness so that people may \nlike to associate with him and extend a hand of friendship towards him. \n227Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) uttered this sentence when Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas, \nMuhammad ibn Maslamah and Abdullah ibn `Umar refused to support him \nagainst the people of Jamal. He means to say that these people are so much \nagainst him that neither his words nor any evidence suffice to reproof, rebuke or \ncorrect them. \nconfined to a few, but now that its expanse has widened and it is firmly \nsettled, everyone is free in his action.228\n \n18. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following about those \nwho avoided fighting on his side: They abandoned righteousness but did \nnot support wrong.229\n \n19. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Whoever \ngallops with a loose rein collides with death. \n \n20. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Forgive the \nshortcomings of considerate people because when they fall into error, \nAllah raises them up. \n \n21. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The \nconsequence of fear is disappointment and of bashfulness is frustration. \nOpportunity passes away like the cloud. Therefore, make use of good \nopportunities..230\n \n228The idea here is that since in the dawn of Islam the number of \nMuslims was limited, it was necessary to keep them distinct from the Jews in \norder to maintain their collective entity. The Prophet (h), therefore, ordered the \nuse of hair-dye which was not in use among the Jews. Besides, it was also the \naim that when facing the enemy the people should not look old and weak.\n229This saying is about those who claimed to be neutral such as \nAbdullah ibn Umar, Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas, Abu Musa al-Ash`ari, al-Ahnaf ibn \nQays, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Usamah ibn Zayd and Anas ibn Malik. \nUndoubtedly, these people did not openly support wrong but did not support \nright, either. Such a conduct is also a kind of support for wrong. Therefore, they \nwill be counted among the opponents of what is right. \n230However bad a thing may be regarded among the people, and \nhowever it may be looked down upon, if it is not really bad, then to feel bashful \nabout it is quite foolish because it will often cause deprivation from things \nwhich are the source of successes and achievements in this as well as in the next \nworld. For example, if a man fears lest people should regard him as ignorant; \ntherefore, he feels bashful in asking about an important and a necessary issue, \nthen this misplaced bashfulness will result in his being deprived of knowledge. \nHence, no sane person should feel bashful about making enquiries. Thus, an old \nman who was learning despite his old age was asked once whether he did not \nfeel ashamed of learning in his old age. He replied in the following: “I do not \nfeel any shame for being ignorant in my old age. How can I feel shame for \nlearning in old age? Of course, to feel shame in doing things which are really \n22. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: We have a \nright. If it is granted to us, that is good; otherwise, we will ride on the \nhind of the camel even though the night journey may be long. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “This is a very fine and \neloquent expression. It means that if we are not allowed to enjoy our \nright, we will be regarded as humble. This sense comes out from this \nexpression because on the rear part of the camel only slaves, prisoners or \nother people of this type used to ride.”.231\n \n23. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: If the deeds of \nsomeone accord (him) a back status, he cannot be given a front status \nsimply on account of his lineage. \n \n24. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: To render \nrelief to the grief-stricken and to provide comfort in hardship means the \natonement of great sins. \n \nbad and mischievous is the essence of humanity and nobility. For instance, there \nare immoral deeds which are bad according to religion, intelligence and ethics. \nIn any case, the first kind of bashfulness is bad and the second is good.” In this \nregard, the Holy Prophet’s saying is this: “Bashfulness is of two kinds: \nbashfulness of intelligence and bashfulness of foolishness. The bashfulness of \nintelligence is knowledge, whereas the bashfulness of foolishness is ignorance.” \n231The interpretation written by Sayyid ar-Radi is that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) intends to say that if our right, that lies with others in our status, as with the \nImam whom it is obligatory to obey, is acknowledged and we are given the \nchance of worldly rule, it is well and good; otherwise, we will have to bear all \nsorts of hardships and ignominies, and we shall be compelled to live the life of \nignominy and humiliation for some time to come. Some commentators have \nadopted a different meaning than this, namely that: “If our status is belittled and \nput aside while others are given precedence over us, we shall bear it patiently \nand agree to remain behind, and this is what is meant by riding on the hind part \nof the camel because the person who rides on the hind part is on the rear while \nthe person who sits on its back is in the fore. Some people take it to mean that if \nwe are allowed our right we will accept it, but if it is not given, we shall not \nbehave like the rider who gives over the rein of his animal to someone else who \nis free to take him wherever he likes, but we shall stick to our right even though \na long time may elapse rather than surrender to the usurpers. \n25. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: O son of \nAdam! When you see that your Lord, the Glorified One, bestows His \nfavors on you while you are disobeying Him, you should fear Him.232\n \n26. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Whenever a \nperson conceals a thing in his heart, it manifests itself through \nunintentional words from his tongue and (in) the expressions of his \nface.233\n \n27. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Keep walking \nin your sickness as long as you can.234\n \n232When a person goes on receiving favors despite his accumulated \nsins, he develops a misconception that Allah is pleased with him, and that this is \nthe result of His pleasure because the increase in favors arises out of \ngratefulness. In the event of ungratefulness, the bestowal of favors stops. In this \nsense, Allah says the following: “Your Lord declared: ‘If you are grateful, I will \nincrease (My favors) on you, and if you are ungrateful, verily, My torment is \nindeed severe” (Holy Quran, 14: 7). Nevertheless, the continuous bestowal of \nfavors, despite disobedience and ungratefulness, cannot be the result of Allah’s \npleasure, nor can it be said that in this way Allah has put him under the \nmisconception that he should regard this exuberance of favors as the result of \nAllah’s pleasure because when he knows that he is a sinner and disobedient, \nfully recognizing his sins and vices, then there are no grounds for misconception \non his part by assuming Allah’s pleasure and consent. He should rather think \nthat this is a sort of trial and a respite. When his sinfulness and high-handedness \nreaches its zenith, he will be caught at once. Therefore, in such a case, he should \nkeep waiting as to when Allah’s favors are taken away from him and he is \npunished with deprivation. \n233The things which a man wants to conceal from others do, indeed, \ncome out on his tongue one time or another, and his effort at concealment is \nunsuccessful. This is so because although the far-sighted mind desires to keep \nthem concealed, yet sometimes it gets entangled in some more important matter \nand becomes careless on this score when the concealed thing comes out in \narticulated words. When the mind becomes attentive, it is not possible to undo \nthe matter just as an arrow cannot be recalled after being shot. Even if this is not \nthe case and the mind is fully cautious and attentive, the thing cannot remain \nconcealed because the lines of the face are indicative of mental feelings and \nreflect the heart’s emotions; consequently, redness of the face can easily point \nout to the sense of shame. \n234The idea here is that as long as sickness does not become serious do \nnot give it importance because by giving importance the feelings get affected \nand the illness increases. Therefore, continue your activity and regard oneself as \n28. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The best part \nof moderation is to conceal it. \n \n29. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: When you are \nrunning away from the world and death is approaching, there is no \nquestion of delay in the encounter. \n \n30. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Fear! Fear! \nBy Allah, He has hidden your sins, so much so that it is as though He has \nforgiven them! \nFaith, Unbelief, Doubt and Their Pillars \n31. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), was asked once about faith. He \nsaid the following: “Faith stands on four pillars: endurance, conviction, \njustice and jihad. \n \nEndurance, again, has four aspects: eagerness, fear, abstention \n(from the allurements of the world) and anticipation (of death). So, \nwhoever is eager for Paradise will ignore his passions; whoever fears the \nFire (of Hell) will refrain from committing prohibited deeds; whoever \nabstains from the world takes hardships lightly, and whoever anticipates \ndeath will hasten towards good deeds. \n \nConviction, also, has four aspects: prudent perception, \nintelligence and understanding, drawing lessons from instructive things \nand following the precedents of past people. So, whoever perceives with \nprudence, wise knowledge will be manifest to him, and to whomsoever \nwise knowledge becomes manifest he appreciates instructive objectives, \nand whoever appreciates instructive objectives is just like past people. \n \nJustice also has four aspects: keen understanding, deep \nknowledge, a good power of decision and firm forbearance. Therefore, \nwhoever understands comes to acquire the depth of knowledge; whoever \nacquires the depth of knowledge drinks from the spring of judgement, and \nwhoever exercises forbearance never commits evil actions in his affairs \nand leads a praiseworthy life among the people. \n \nbeing well. This will dispel your sickness and also prevent the power of \nresistance from getting weak. It keeps up its psychological power, while the \npsychological power curbs small ailments by itself, provided it is not forced to \ngive up resistance by surrendering the imagination to the ailment. \nJihad, also, has four aspects: enjoining others to do good, keeping \naway others from doing evil, fighting (in the way of Allah) sincerely and \nfirmly on all occasions and detesting anyone who is vicious. So, whoever \nasks others to do good provides strength to the believers; whoever \ndissuades others from committing evil humiliates the unbelievers; \nwhoever fights sincerely on all occasions carries out all his obligations, \nand whoever detests the vicious and becomes angry for the sake of Allah, \nthen Allah will be angry in favor of him and will keep him pleased on the \nDay of Judgement. \n \nUnbelief stands on four pillars: hankering after whims, quarreling \nwith others, deviating from the truth and dissenting. So, whoever hankers \nafter whims does not incline towards right; whoever quarrels much on \naccount of ignorance remains permanently blinded from what is right; \nwhoever deviates from the truth, for him good becomes evil and evil \nbecomes good and he remains intoxicated with misguidance, and whoever \nmakes a breach (with Allah and His Messenger), his path becomes \ndifficult, his affairs become complicated and his way of escape becomes \nnarrow.\n \nDoubt has also four aspects: irrationality, fear, wavering and \nundue submission to everything. So, whoever adopts irrationality as his \nway of life, for him there is no dawn after the night; whoever is afraid of \nwhat befalls him has to run on his heels; whoever wavers in doubt, the \nsatans trample upon him with their feet, and whoever submits to the \ndestruction of this and the next world succumbs to it. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “We have left out the \nremaining portion of this saying for fear of length and for being outside \nthe purpose of this chapter.” \n \n32. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The doer of good is better \nthan the good itself, and the doer of evil is worse than the evil itself. \n \n33. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Be generous \nbut not extravagant; be thrifty but not stingy. \n \n34. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The best of \nriches is the abandonment of desires. \n35. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: If someone is \nquick in saying about people what they dislike, they will speak about him \nthat with which they have no knowledge. \n \n36. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Whoever \nprolongs his desire ruins his actions. \n \n37. Once Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was proceeding towards \nSyria when the countrymen of al-Anbar met him. Seeing him, they began \nto walk on foot then ran in front of him. He inquired why they were doing \nso. They replied that this was the way they respected their chiefs. Then he \nsaid the following: “By Allah, this does not benefit your chiefs. You are \nbelaboring yourself in this world and earning misery for the next by it. \nHow harmful is the labour in whose wake there is punishment, and how \nprofitable is the case with which there is deliverance from the Fire (of \nHell)!\nThe Imam Admonishing His Son: \n \n38. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following to his son al-\nHassan (x): O son! Learn four things and (a further) four things from me: \nNothing will harm you if you practice them. The richest of all riches is \nintelligence; the biggest destitution is foolishness; the most wild of the \nwild is vanity, and the best achievement is goodness of the moral \ncharacter. \n \nO my son! You should avoid making friends with a fool because \nif he intends to benefit you, he will harm you. You should avoid making \nfriends with a miser because he will run away from you when you need \nhim the most. You should avoid making friends with a sinful person \nbecause he will sell you for nought. And you should avoid making friends \nwith a liar because he is like a mirage, making you see far things as near \nand near things as far. \n \n39. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: \nSupererogatory worship cannot bring about nearness to Allah if it \nhampers what is obligatory. \n \n40. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The tongue of \nthe wise man is behind his heart, while the heart of the fool is behind his \ntongue.\nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “This sentence has a strange \nand beautiful meaning. It means that the wise man does not speak with his \ntongue except after consulting his mind and exercising his imagination, \nbut the fool quickly utters whatever comes to his tongue without \npondering. In this way, the tongue of the wise man follows his heart while \nthe heart of the fool follows his tongue.” \n \n41. This very notion has been related from Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) in a different version thus: The heart of a fool is in his mouth, \nwhile the tongue of the wise man is in his heart. The meaning of both the \nsaying (40 and 41) is the same. \n \n42. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following to one of his \ncompanions during the latter’s sickness: May Allah make your illness a \nmeans for wiping out your sins because there is no reward for sickness \nbut that it erases sins and makes them fall like (dried) leaves. Reward lies \nin saying by the tongue and doing something with the limbs. Certainly, \nAllah, the Glorified One, admits into Paradise by virtue of truthfulness of \nintention and chastity of heart whomsoever He wishes from among His \nservants.\n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nis right in saying that there is no reward for sickness as such because \ncompensation is admissible with regard to how Allah, the Sublime One, \ndeals with His creatures such as causing them grief, illness and the like. \nHowever, reward and recompense become admissible with regard to the \nactions of the creature. This is the difference between the two. Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) has clarified it through his lustrous knowledge and \nsound view. \n \n43. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following about Khabbab \nibn al-Aratt:1\n \nMay Allah have mercy on Khabbab ibn al-Aratt since he accepted \nIslam willingly, immigrated (from Mecca) obediently, remained content \nwith what sufficed him, was pleased with Allah and lived the life of a \nmujahid.Khabbab ibn al-Aratt was a distinguished companion of the Holy \nProphet (h) and was one of the early Muhajirun. He suffered various \nsorts of hardships at the hands of the tribesmen of Quraish. He was made \nto stand in the scorching sun and to lie down on burning pieces of timber, \nbut he did not at all abandon the side of the Holy Prophet (h). He \naccompanied the Holy Prophet (h) in Badr and other battles. He \nsupported Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in Siffin and Nahrawan. He had \nleft Medina and settled in Kufa. Thus, he died there in 39 A.H. (659 A.D.) \nat the age of 73. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) led his funeral prayer \nservice. He was buried outside Kufa. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) uttered \nthese mercy-invoking words as he stood at his grave. \n \n44. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Blessed is the \nperson who kept in mind the next life, acted so as to be able to render his \naccount, remained content with what sufficed him and remained pleased \nwith Allah. \n \n45. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Even if I \nstrike thenose of a believer with this, my sword, so he may hate me, he \nwill not hate me, and even if I pile all the wealth of the world before a \nhypocrite (Muslim) so he may love me, he will not love me. This is so \nbecause it is a verdict pronounced by the tongue of the revered Prophet \n(h) who said the following: “O Ali! A believer will never hate you and a \nhypocrite (Muslim) will never love you.235\n \n235This is one of the authentic traditions (ahadth) of the Holy Prophet \n(h) whose authenticity the scholars of traditions had never doubted. It was \nnarrated by certain companions of the Holy Prophet (h) such as `Abdullah ibn \n`Abbas, Imran ibn al-Hasin, Umm al-Mu’minin (mother of the faithful) Umm \nSalamah and others such as Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) himself who also \nnarrated saying: By the One Who split the seed and created the soul, verily the \nMessenger of Allah (x) and his progeny gave me a promise that no one but a \n(true) believer will love me, and none but a hypocrite will hate me (Sahh,\nMuslim, Vol. 1, p. 60; [Muslim, in his book, regards the love of Ali as the sign \nof dissemblance] Al-Jami’al-Sahih, Vol. 5, pp. 635, 643; Al-Sunan, Ibn Majah, \nVol. 1, p. 55; Al-Sunan, al-Nisa’i, Vol. 8, pp. 115-116, 117; Al-Musnad, Ahmed \nibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, pp. 84, 95, 128; Vol. 6, p. 292; AIlal al-hadith, Abu Hatim, \nVol. 2, p. 400; Hilyat al-Awliya’, Abu Nu’aym, Vol. 4, p. 185; Jami’al-Usul, Ibn\nal-Athir, Vol. 9, p. 473; Mujma’ az-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, p. 133; Manaqib Ali ibn \nAbu Talib, Ibn al-Maghazili, pp. 190-195; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1100; Usd al-\nGhaba, Vol. 4, p. 26; Al-Isaba, Vol. 2, p. 509; Tarikh Baghdad, Vol. 2, p. 255; \nVol. 8, p. 417; Vol. 14, p. 426; Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 7, p. 354). It was in this \nway that the companions of the Holy Prophet (h) used to test the faith (iman) or \nhypocrisy (nifaq) of the Muslims through their love or hatred towards Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x), as is related from Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Abu Sa’id al-Khudri, \nAbdullah ibn Mas`ud and Jabir ibn Abdullah [al-Ansari] that: We (companions \nof the Holy Prophet [h]) used to distinguish the hypocrites by their hatred of \n46. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The sin that \ndispleases you is better in the view of Allah than the virtue that makes \nyou proud.236\n \n47. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The worth of \na man is according to his courage, his truthfulness is according to his \nbalance of temper, his valor is according to his self-respect and his \nchastity is according to his sense of shame. \n \n48. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Victory is \n(won) with determination; determination is pondering over thoughts and \nthoughts are formed by guarding secrets. \n \n49. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: Fear the \nmight of a noble person when he is hungry and that of an ignoble person \nwhen he is satisfied.237.\n \n50. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: The hearts of \nthe people are like wild beasts. If someone tries to tame them, they will \npounce back upon him.238\n \nAli ibn Abu Talib (al-Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, p. 635; Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, p. 129;\nHilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 6, p. 294; Mujma’az-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, pp. 132-133; Jami’ \nal-Usul, Vol. 9, p. 473; Al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. 6, pp. 66-67; Tarikh Baghdad, \nVol. 13, p. 153; Ar-Riyad an-Nadira, Vol. 2, pp. 214-215; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. \n1110; Usd al-Ghaba, Vol. 4, pp. 29-30).\n236The person who feels ashamed and repentant after committing a sin \nand offers repentance before Allah remains safe from the penalty of that sin and \ndeserves the reward of repentance. But the person who, having done a virtuous \ndeed, begins to feel his “superiority” over others and becomes proud of his \nvirtues thinks that he has no apprehension whatever. Thus, he destroys his virtue \nand remains deprived of the reward of that virtuous deed. Obviously, whoever \nhas erased the shame of his sin by repentance will be better than one who ruins \nhis action by being proud of it without having repented of such a pride.\n237The meaning is that a man of prestige and esteem never tolerates \nhumiliation or disgrace. If his honor is assailed, he will leap like a hungry lion \nand break away the shackles of humiliation. If a low and narrow minded person \nis raised beyond what he deserves, he will not be able to contain himself but, \nregarding himself very high, he will assail the status of others. \n238This statement confirms the theory that by nature, human hearts love \nwildness and that the feeling of love and affection in them is an acquired \nattribute. Consequently, when the elements and causes of love and affection \n51. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following: So long as \nyour status is good, your defects will remain covered. \n \n52. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Themost capable of \npardoning is whoever is the most powerful to punish. \n \n53. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Generosity is that which is \nby one’s own initiative because giving on being asked is either out of self-\nrespect or to avoid rebuke. \n \n54. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There is no wealth like \nwisdom, no destitution like ignorance, no inheritance like refinement and \nno support like consultation. \n \n55. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Patience is of two kinds: \npatience over what pains you, and patience regarding what you covet. \n \n56. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: With wealth, a strange land \nis a homeland, while with destitution, even a homeland is a strange \nland..239 A stranger even in his own homeland. \n \n57. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Contentment is wealth that \ndoes not diminish.240\n \ncrop up, they get tamed. But when these elements disappear, or when the \nfeelings of hatred are created against them, the people return to wildness and \nthereafter they return to the path of love and affection with a great deal of \ndifficulty. Do not tease the heart because it is a wild bird. If once it flies away, it \nwill come down with a great deal of difficulty. \n239A person who has wealth and riches will get friends and \nacquaintances wherever he may be. He, therefore, will not feel strange in any \nforeign land. But if he is poor and destitute, he will have no friends even in his \nhomeland because people do not like to make friends with the poor and the \ndestitute, nor to extend relations with them. He is, therefore, a stranger even at \nhome and has no friends or well-wishers. \nWhoever has no worldly successor remains unknown: \n240Contentment means that a man should remain satisfied with what he \ngets and should not complain if he gets less. If he is not so contented, he will try \nto satisfy his greed by committing social crimes such as misappropriation, \ncheating and deceiving others because greed compels one to satisfy one’s needs \nSayyid ar-Radi says, “This saying has also been related from the \nProphet (h).”\n \n58. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Wealth is the fountainhead \nof passions. \n \n59. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who warns you is like \none who gives you good tidings. \n \n60. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The tongue is a beast; when \nit is let loose, it devours. \n \n61. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Woman is a scorpion whose \ntouch is sweet. \n \n62. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If you are met with a \ngreeting, give better greetings in return. If a hand of help is extended to \nyou, do a better favor in return, although the credit will remain with the \none who was the first. \n \n63. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who intercedes is the \nwing of one who seeks. \n \n64. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The people of the world are \nlike travelers who are being carried while they are asleep. \n \n65. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A lack of friends means \nstrangeness.\n \n66. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: To miss what one needs is \neasier than to beg from an inappropriate person.241\n \nby any means whatever. Then the satisfaction of one’s need opens the gate for \nanother need and so on. As a man’s needs get satisfied, his craving increases, \nand he can never get rid of his needs or of dissatisfaction. The increasing \ndissatisfaction can be stopped only by contentment which makes a man carefree \nfrom all wants except the most essential ones. This is that everlasting wealth that \ngives satisfaction for good. \n241The shame that is felt in putting a request before an inappropriate \nperson gives more mental pain than the grief in not obtaining its fulfillment. \n67. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do not feel ashamed for \ngiving little because refusal is smaller than that. \n \n68. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Charity is the adornment of \ndestitution, while gratefulness (to Allah) is the adornment of riches. \n \n69. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If what you aim at does not \ncome about, then do not worry as to what you were. \n \n70. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: You will not find an \nignorant person but at one extreme or another (i.e. a person who neglects \nor a person who exaggerates). \n \n71. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: As intelligence increases, \nspeech decreases.242\n \n72. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Time wears out bodies, \nrenews desires, brings death nearer and takes away aspirations. Whoever \nis successful with it encounters grief, and whoever misses its favors also \nundergoes hardships. \n \n73. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever places himself as \na leader of the people should commence with educating his own self \nbefore educating others, and his teaching should be by his own conduct \nbefore teaching by the tongue. The person who teaches and instructs his \nown self is more entitled to esteem than whoever teaches and instructs \nothers.\n \nThat is why non-fulfillment of a request can be tolerated, but the obligation of a \nlow and humble person is intolerable. Every self-respecting person will, \ntherefore, prefer deprivation to being under obligation to an inappropriate man \nand will not tolerate placing his request before a low and mean person. \n242Being talkative is an indication of a diffused thinking, while \ndiffusion of thought is the result of the unripeness of wisdom. When wisdom \nattains perfection and understanding ripens, one’s mind and thoughts are \nbalanced. Wisdom acquires power and control over the tongue. As over other \nparts of the body, the tongue does not deed any thinking or anything outside the \ndictates of wisdom. Obviously, uttering after thinking is short and free from \nextras. As a man’s intelligence increases, his speech decreases and he does not \nspeak save at the opportune moment. \n74. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Each breath taken by a man \nis a step towards his death.243\n \n75. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Every countable thing is to \npass way and every expected thing must come about. \n \n76. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If matters get mixed up, \nthen the last ones should be appreciated compared to the previous one.244\n \n77. It is related that when Dirar ibn Hamzah (the correct: \nDamrah) ad-Dibabi (or as-Suda’i245) went to Mu`awiyah and Mu`awiyah \n \n243That is just as each step makes way for the other, and this exercise by \nsteps is the means of nearing the goal. Similarly, every breath of life serves as a \ndeath-knell for the previous one and carries life towards death, as if the breath \nwhose motion is regarded as a sign of life is, in fact, the sign of the passing \naway of one moment of life and a means of nearing the goal of death because \neach breath is death for the previous one and life is the name of those very \ndeath-carrying breaths. Every breath is a dead body of the life that passed by. \nLife is the name of living by facing successive deaths. \n244By looking at a seed, a cultivator can say what plant will come out of \nit, what fruits, flowers or leaves it will have and what its expanse will be. \nLikewise, a guess can be made about the success of a student by looking at his \nlabor and effort. The same applies to the failure of some other student by \nlooking at his leisureliness and idleness because the beginning is indicative of \nthe end and the premises of the conclusion. Therefore, if the end of any matter is \nnot visible, its beginning should be looked at. If its beginning is bad, the end, \ntoo, will be bad, and if the beginning is good, the end, too, will be good. An \nauspicious river begins from the very spring. \n245Dirar ibn Damrah was one of the companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x). After the death of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), he went to Syria where \nhe met Mu`awiyah. Mu`awiyah said to him, “Describe Ali to me.” He replied, \n“Will you please excuse me from answering this?” But Mu`awiyah emphasized, \n“You must describe him,” whereupon Dirar said the following: “If there is no \nalternative, then you should know that Ali (x) was a man whose personality \nknew no limits, terrific in power, his speech was decisive, his judgements based \non justice, his knowledge spread out in all directions and wisdom manifested \nitself on all his behavior. Among the food he liked the most was the coarse kind \nand among the clothes, the short (and humble) ones. By Allah, he was among us \nlike one of us. He used to respond to our questions and fulfil all our requests. By \nAllah, although he used to let us get close to him and he himself was close to us, \nwe did not dare address him due to our feeling of awe towards him nor did we \ndare to speak first due to his greatness in our hearts. His smile displayed a row \ninquired from him about Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), he said the \nfollowing: “I testify that I have seen him on several occasions when night \nhad spread and he was standing in the niche (of the mosque) holding his \nbeard, groaning like a man bitten by a snake and weeping as a grieved \nman, saying: O world, O world! Get away from me! Why do you present \nyourself tome?! Or are you eager for me?! You may not get that \nopportunity to impress me. Deceive some other person. I have no concern \nwith you. I have divorced you thrice after which there is no restitution. \nYour life is short, your importance is little and your liking is humble. \nAlas! The provision is little, the way is long, the journey is far and the \ngoal is hard to reach.” \nOn the Subject of Predestination\n \n78. A man inquired from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saying, \n“Was our going to fight the Syrians destined by Allah?” Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) detailed his reply, a selection from which is here: \nWoe unto you! You take it as a final and unavoidable destiny246\n(according to which we are bound to act). If it were so, there would have \nbeen no question of reward or chastisement and there would have been no \nsense in Allah’s promises or warnings. (On the other hand) Allah, the \n \nof pearls. He used to honor the pious; to be kind to the needy, to feed the orphan, \nthe near of kin or the needy man in the day of hunger, clothe bare ones and help \nthe vulnerable person. He used to detest the world and its flowering. I testify to \nall of this.” (So far, the testimony is as quoted above by Sayyid ar-Radi). When \nMu`awiyah heard this from Dirar, his eyes became full of tears and he said: \n“May Allah have mercy on Abul-Hassan. He really was so.” Then, turning to \nDirar he said: How do you feel in his absence, O Dirar?” Dirar replied, “My \ngrief is like that of a woman whose only child is butchered in her own arms” \n(Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, pp. 1107-1108; Hilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 2, p. 84; Sifatul-\nSafwah, Ibn al-Jawzi, Vol. 1, p. 121; Al-Amali, Abu Ali al-Qali, Vol. 2, p. 147; \nZahr al-Adab, al-Husari, Vol. 1, pp. 40-41; Muruj al-Dhahab, Vol. 2, p. 421; \nAr-Riyad al-Nadira, Al-Muhibb al-Tabari, Vol. 2, p. 212; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. \n18, pp. 225-226). \n246The end of this story is that after this, the man inquired, “What kind \nof destiny it was by which we had to go?” and Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, \n“¨?n (destiny) means the command of Allah. For example, He has said: wa \nqada rabbuka alla ta’budu illa iyyahu (And your Lord commanded that you \nshall worship none but Him [Holy Quran, 17: 23]). Here, the Arabic word ¨?n \nstands for commanded. \nGlorified One, has ordered His servants to act according to their free will \nand has cautioned them and protected them (from evil). He has placed \neasy obligations on them and has not put heavy obligations. He gives \nthem much (reward) in return for little action. He is disobeyed, not \nbecause He is overpowered. He is obeyed but not by force. He did not \nsend prophets just for fun. He did not send down the Book for the people \nwithout a purpose. He did not create the skies, the earth and all that is in \nbetween them in vain. That is the imagination of those who disbelieve: “... \nthen woe unto those who disbelieve because of the fire” (Holy Quran, 38: \n27).\n \n79. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Take wise points from \nwherever they may be because if a wise saying is in the bosom of a \nhypocrite, it flutters in his bosom till it comes out and settles with others \nof its own category: in the bosom of the believer. \n \n80. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A wise saying is a lost \narticle of the believer. Therefore, get wise sayings even though from \npeople of hypocrisy. \n \n81. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The worth of every man is \nin his attainments.247\n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that this is the statement whose value cannot \nbe assessed, with which no wise saying can be weighed and with which \nno other sentence can be matched. \n \n82. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I impart to you five things \nwhich, if you ride your camels fast in search of them, you will find them \nworth the effort: \n \nNone of you should repose hope save in his Lord (Allah); none of \nyou should fear anything save his sin; none should feel ashamed of \nsaying, “I do not know” when he is asked about a matter which he does \n \n247The real value of a person is his knowledge (and perfection of \nattainment). His worth and status will be in accordance with the status of \nknowledge and attainment which he holds. Eyes that are conscious of real values \ndo not look at the face, features, tallness of stature, size or worldly pomp and \nstatus. Rather, they look at the attainments of a person and assess his worth \naccording to these attainments. The conclusion is that a man should strive to \nacquire distinction and be admonished. The worth of every person is according \nto the extent of his knowledge. \nnot know; none should feel ashamed of learning a thing that he does not \nknow and you should practice endurance because endurance is for belief \nwhat the head is for the body: Just as there is no good in a body without \nthe head, there is no good in belief without endurance. \n \n83. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following about a man \nwho praised him much, although he did not admire him: I am below what \nyou express and above what you feel in your heart. \n \n84. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The survivors of the sword \nare large in number and have many offspring. \n \n85. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever abandons saying, \n“I do not know” meets his destruction. \n \n86. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I love the opinion of an old \nman more than the determination of a young man: (or according to \nanother version: more than the martyrdom of a young man.) \n \n87. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I wonder about the man \nwho loses hope despite the possibility of seeking forgiveness. \n \n88. (Imam) Abu Ja`far Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir (x), has \nrelated from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) that the Imam had said: There \nwere two sources of deliverance from the punishment of Allah: one of \nthem has been raised up, while the other is before you. You should, \ntherefore, adhere to it. The source of deliverance, which has been raised \nup is the Messenger of Allah Muhammad (k), while the source of \ndeliverance that remains is the seeking of forgiveness. Allah, the Glorified \nOne, has said the following: “And Allah is not to chastise them while you \nare among them, nor is Allah to chastise them while yet they seek [His] \nforgiveness’ (Holy Quran, 8: 33). \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that this is one of the most beautiful ways of \nderiving the meaning and a most delicate manner of an interpretation. \n \n89. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If a man behaves properly \nin matters between himself and Allah, then Allah will keep proper the \nmatters between him and other people. And if a man keeps proper the \naffairs of his next life, then Allah keeps proper for him the affairs of this \nworld. Whoever is a preacher for himself is protected by Allah. \n90. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The perfect jurist of Islam is \nwhoever does not let people lose hope from the mercy of Allah, does not \nmake him despondent of Allah’s kindness and does not make him feel \nsafe from Allah’s punishment. \n \n91. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The hearts get disgusted as \nbodies get disgusted; so look for beautiful wise sayings for them. \n \n92. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The most humble \nknowledge is that which remains on the tongue and the most honorable \none is that which manifests itself through (the action of) the limbs and the \norgans of the body. \n \n93. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: None of you should say, “O \nAllah! I seek Your protection from affliction” because there is none who \nis not afflicted. But whoever seeks Allah’s protection should seek it from \nmisguiding troubles because Allah, the Glorified One, says the following: \n“And be admonished that your wealth and your children are a trial” (Holy \nQuran, 8: 28). It means that He tries people with wealth and progeny in \norder to distinguish one who is displeased with his livelihood from one \nwho is happy with what he has been given. Even though Allah, the \nGlorified One, knows them more than they know themselves, yet He does \nso to let them perform actions with which they earn reward or \npunishment. This is so because some of them like to have male (children) \nand dislike to have female (children), whereas some like to amass wealth \nand dislike adversity. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that this is a wonderful interpretation related \nfrom the Imam (x).\n \n94. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked what is good; he \nreplied thus: Good is not that your wealth and progeny should be much, \nbut good is that your knowledge should be much, your forbearance should \nbe great and that you should vie with other people in worshipping Allah. \nIf you do good deeds, you should thank Allah, but if you commit evil, you \nshould seek forgiveness of Allah. In this world, good is for two persons \nonly: the man who commits sins but rectifies them by repentance, and the \nman who hastens towards good deeds. \n95. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Action accompanied by fear \nfor Allah does not fail; how can a thing fail that has been accepted?!248\n \n96. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The persons most attracted \nto the prophets are those who know most what the prophets have brought. \nThen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) recited this verse: “Verily, of men, the \nnearest to Abraham are surely those who followed him and this (Our) \nProphet (h) (Muhammad [h]) and those who believe” (Holy Quran, 3: \n68). Then he said the following: The friend of Muhammad (h) is \nwhoever obeys Allah, even though he may have no blood relationship \n[with him], and the enemy of Muhammad (h) is whoever disobeys Allah \neven though he may have near kinship [with the Prophet (h)]. \n \n97. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) heard about a Kharijite who said \nthe mid-night prayers and recited the Holy Quran, then he said: Sleeping \nin a state of firm belief is better than praying in a state of doubt. \n \n98. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When you hear a tradition, \ntest it according to the criterion of intelligence not to that of mere hearsay \nbecause those who relate knowledge are numerous, but those who \nsafeguard it are few. \n \n99. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) heard a man reciting the \nfollowing: “Verily, we are Allah’s, and verily to Him shall we return” \n(Holy Quran, 2: 156). The Imam (x) said: Our saying, “Inna li’llah \n(Verily we are Allah’s) is an admission of His majesty over us, while our \nsaying, “Wa inna ilayhi raji’un” (and verily to Him shall we return) is an \nadmission of our being mortal. \n \n100. Some people praised Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in his \npresence. The Imam (x) said: O Lord! You know me better than I know \nmyself, and I know myself better than they know. O Lord! Make us better \npeople than what they think and forgive us for what they do not know. \n \n101. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The fulfillment of (others’) \nneeds becomes a lasting virtue in three ways: regarding it as small, so that \n \n248Allah says the following: “Verily, Verily, Allah does accept (an \noffering only) from those who guard (themselves against evil)” (Holy” Quran, 5: \n27). \nit attains bigness, concealing it so that it may manifest itself, and doing it \nquickly so that it becomes pleasant. \n \n102. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Shortly, a time will come \nfor people when high [government] positions will be given only to those \nwho defame others, when vicious people will be regarded as witty and \njust will be regarded as weak. People will regard charity as a loss, \nconsideration for kinship as a burden and worship as grounds for claiming \ngreatness among others. At such a time, authority will be exercised \nthrough the counsel of women, and there will be posting of young boys in \nhigh positions and the running of the administration by eunuchs. \n \n103. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was publicly seen in worn-out \nclothes with patches. When it was pointed out to him, he said: With it \n[such shabbiness of dressing] the heart fears, the mind feels humble and \nthe believers emulate it. Certainly this world and the next are two enemies \nof each other, two paths in opposite directions. Whoever likes this world \nand loves it hates the next and is its enemy. These two are like the East \nand the West. If the walker between them gets near to one, he gets farther \nfrom the other. After all, they are like two fellow-wives. \n \n104. It is related by Nawf al-Bikali that: “One night, I saw Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) coming out of his bed and looking at the stars. Then \nhe said to me: ‘O Nawf! Are you awake or are you sleeping?’ I said: ‘I am \nawake, O Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)!’ whereupon the Imam (x) said the \nfollowing: O Nawf! Blessed be those who abstain from this world and are \neager for the next one. They are the people who regard this earth as the \nfloor; its dust as their bed-cloth, and its water as their perfume. They \nrecite the Holy Quran in low tones and supplicate in high tones then they \nare cut off from the world like sa (Jesus) was. \n \n‘O Nawf! Prophet Dawud (David) (x) rose up at a similar hour \none night and said: This is the hour when whatever a person pleads, his \nplea is granted to him unless he is a tax-collector, an intelligence man, a \npolice officer, a lute player or a drummer.’” \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says the following: “It is also said that ‘artabah’ \nmeans Bq (drum) and ‘kubah’ means lute.” \n \n105. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Allah has placed on you \nsome obligations which you should not ignore, has laid down for you \nlimits which you should not transgress, has prohibited you from certain \nthings which you should not violate and has kept quiet about certain \nthings, but He has not left them out by mistake so that you should not find \nthem. \n \n106. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If people give up \nsomething relevant to religion to set right their worldly affairs, Allah will \ninflict upon them something more harmful than that. \n \n107. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Often the ignorance of a \nlearned man ruins him while the knowledge he has does not avail him. \n \n108. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: In man, there is a piece of \nflesh attached to him: a vein, and it is the strangest thing in him. It is the \nheart. It has a store of wisdom and things contrary to wisdom. If it sees a \nray of hope, eagerness humiliates it, and when eagerness increases, greed \nruins it. If disappointment overtakes it, grief kills it. If anger rises in it, a \nserious rage develops. If it is blessed with pleasure, it forgets to be \ncautious. If it becomes fearing, it becomes heedless. If peace extends all \nround, it becomes neglectful. If it earns wealth, freedom from care puts it \nin the wrong. If trouble befalls it, impatience makes it humble. If it faces \nstarvation, distress overtakes it. If hunger attacks it, weakness seats it. If \nits food increases, heaviness of stomach pains it. Thus, every shortness is \nharmful to it and every excess is injurious to it. \n \n109. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: We (members of the \nProphet’s family) are like the pillow in the middle. Whoever lags behind \nhas to come forward to meet it, while whoever exceeds the bounds has to \nreturn to it. \n \n110. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: None can establish the rule \nof Allah, the Glorified One, except whoever shows no relenting (in the \nmatter of right), who does not behave like wrong doers and who does not \nrun after greed. \n \n111. Sahl ibn Hunayf al-Ansari died at Kufa after his return from \nthe battle of Siffin and he was very much loved by Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x). On this occasion, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Even if a \nmountain had loved me, it will have crumbled down. \nSayyid ar-Radi says that the meaning of this is that since the trial \nof the man who loves Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) will be so, severe \ntroubles will leap towards him and this is not the case except with the \nGod-fearing, the virtuous and the select good ones. There is another \nsimilar saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s individuals, namely: \n \n112. Whoever loves us, members of the Household (of the \nProphet [h]), should be prepared to face destitution. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that this has been interpreted in a different \nway as well, but on this occasion, it is not fit to mention here.249\n \n113. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: No wealth is more \nprofitable than wisdom; no loneliness is more estranging than vanity, no \nwisdom is as good as tact, no honor is like fear from Allah, no companion \nis like the goodness of moral character, no inheritance is like civility, no \nguide is like promptitude, no trade is like virtuous deeds, no profit is like \nthe Divine reward, no self-control is like inaction in time of doubt, no \nabstention is like that from prohibitions, no knowledge is like thinking, no \nworship is like the carrying out of obligations, no belief is like modesty \nand endurance, no attainment is like humility, no honor is like knowledge, \nno power is like forbearance and no support is more reliable than \nconsultation. \n \n114. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: At a time when virtue is in \nvogue in the world and among people, if a person entertains an evil \nsuspicion about another person from whom nothing evil has ever been \nseen, then he has been unjust. And at a time when vice is in vogue in the \nworld and among people, if a man entertains a good idea about another \nperson, he flings himself in peril. \n \n115. It was said to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x): “How are you, O \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)?” He replied: How can he be whom life is \ndriving towards death, whose state of health can change into sickness any \nmoment and who is to be caught (by death) from his place of safety. \n \n249Perhaps the other meaning of this saying is this: “Whoever loves us \nshould not hanker after worldly matters even though in consequence he may \nhave to face destitution and poverty; but he should rather remain content and \navoid seeking worldly benefits.” \n116. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There are many people \nwho are given time (by Allah) through good treatment towards them and \nmany who are deceived because their sinful activities are veiled (by \nAllah) and many who are impressed by good talk about themselves. And \nAllah does not try anyone as seriously as He tries him whom He allows \ntime (to remain sinful). \n \n117. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Two categories of persons \nwill face ruin on my account: whoever exaggerates in loving me and \nwhoever hates me intensely. \n \n118. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: To miss an opportunity \nbrings about grief. \n \n119. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The example of the world \nis like a serpent: It is soft in touch but its inside is full of venom. An \nignorant person who has fallen into deceit is attracted towards it, but a \nwise and intelligent man stays on guard against it. \n \n120. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked about the tribesmen \nof Quraish. He replied as follows: As for Banu Makhzum, they are the \nblossoms of the tribesmen of Quraish. It is delightful to talk to their men \nand to marry their women. As for Ban Abd Shams, they are far-sighted \nand cautious about all that is hidden from them. As for ourselves (Banu \nHashim), we spend whatever we get and are very generous in offering \nourselves to death. Consequently, those people are more numerous, more \ncontriving and more ugly while we are most eloquent, well-wishing and \nhandsome. \n \n121. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: What a difference there is \nbetween two kinds of actions: “A deed whose pleasure passes away but its \n(ill) consequence remains, and a deed whose hardship passes away but its \nreward stays. \n \n122. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was present at a funeral when he \nheard someone laugh. He, therefore, said: Is it that death has been \nordained only for others? Is it that right is obligatory only on others? Is it \nthat those whom we see departing on their journey of death will come \nback to us? We lay them down in their graves then enjoy their estate (as if \nwe will live for good after them). We have ignored every preacher, man \nor woman and have exposed ourselves to every catastrophe. \n123. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Blessed be whoever \nhumbles himself, whose livelihood is pure, whose heart is chaste, whose \nhabits are virtuous, who spends his savings (in the name of Allah), who \nprevents his tongue from speaking nonsense, who keeps people safe from \nevil, who is pleased with the (Prophet’s) Sunnah and who is unconnected \nwith innovation (in religion). \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that Some people attribute this and the \nprevious saying to the Messenger of Allah (k).\n \n124. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The jealousy of a woman \n(with co-wives) is heresy, while the jealousy of a man is a part of belief. \n \n125. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I am defining Islam as \nnone has defined it before me: Islam is submission, submission is \nconviction, conviction is affirmation, affirmation is acknowledgment, \nacknowledgment is carrying out (of obligations) and carrying out \nobligations is action. \n \n126. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I wonder at the miser who \nis speeding towards the very destitution from which he wants to run away \nand misses the very ease of life which he covets. Consequently, he passes \nhis life in this world like the destitute but will have to render an account \nin the next world like the rich. \n \nI wonder at the proud man who was just a drop of semen the other \nday and will turn into a corpse tomorrow. I wonder at the man who doubts \nAllah although He sees His creations. I wonder at him who has forgotten \ndeath although he sees people dying. I wonder at him who denies the \nsecond life although he has seen the first. I wonder at him who inhabits \nthis transient abode but ignores the everlasting one. \n \n127. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever falls short of \nactions falls into grief, and Allah has nothing to do with him who spares \nnothing from his wealth in the name of Allah. \n \n128. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Guard yourselves against \ncold in its (seasonal) beginning and welcome it towards its end because it \naffects bodies in the same way as it affects plants. In the beginning, it \ndestroys them, but in the end it gives them fresh leaves.1\n During autumn, protection from cold is necessary because with \nthe change of weather, the temperature of the body also changes and \nailments such as flue, catarrh, cough, etc. occur. This is so because bodies \nare accustomed to hot weather. When suddenly cold comes on, the tissue \nbecomes contracted, and cold dryness increases in the body. Thus, \nbathing with cold water soon after bathing with hot water is harmful for \nthis very reason. With hot water, the tissues expand, so they at once admit \nthe effect of cold water and in consequence the natural heat of the body is \naffected. On the other hand, there is no need for protection from cold \nduring spring season, nor is it harmful for the health because the body is \nalready accustomed to cold. Thus, the temperate cold of the spring is not \nunpleasant to the body. Rather, with the decline of cold, there is an \nincrease of heat and dampness in the body as a result of which growth \ngets impetus, natural heat rises, the body grows, the temperaments feel \npleasant and the spirit is joyful. \n \nSimilarly, there is the same effect in the plant world. Thus, during \nautumn, due to the prevalence of coldness and dryness, the leaves wither, \nthe vegetative power decreases, the freshness of the plants fades and there \nis a death-like effect on the green areas. Spring brings the message of life \nfor them. Then with the blowing of healthy winds, blossoms begin to \nsprout, plants become fresh and healthy, and forests and wildernesses \nacquire a green hue. \n \n129. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The Greatness of the \nCreator appreciated by you will belittle the creatures in your view. \n \n130. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) returned from (the battle \nof) Siffin and noticed the graves outside Kufa, he said: O residents of \nhouses which give a sense of loneliness, of depopulated areas, of gloomy \ngraves! O people of the dust! O victims of strangeness! O people of \nloneliness and O people of desolateness! You have gone ahead and \npreceded us while we are following you and will join you. The houses \n(you left) have been inhabited by others; the wives (you left) have been \nmarried by others; the properties have been distributed (among heirs). \nThis is the news about those around us; what is the news about things \naround you?! \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) turned to his companions and said: \nBeware! If they were allowed to speak they will inform you that: “Verily, \nthe best provision is fear of Allah” (Holy Quran, 2: 197). \nAbout Those Who Unfairly Blame Life in this World\n \n131. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) heard a man speaking ill of life \nin this world, so he said to him: O you who abuses the world! O you who \nhas been deceived by it and cheated by its wrongs! Do you thus covet the \nworld then abuse it?! Do you accuse it or should it accuse you?! When did \nit bewilder you or deceive you, whether by the decay and fall of your \nforefathers, or by the sleeping places of your mothers under the ground? \nHow much did you look after them in their illness and nursed them during \nsickness, desiring them to be cured and consulting physicians for them in \nthe morning when your medicine did not avail them and your wailing for \nthem did not benefit them? Your mourning over them did not prove useful \nto them and you could not achieve your aim. You could not ward off \n(death) from them with all your power. In fact, through the dying man, the \nworld presented an illustration for you and showed you by the example of \nhis falling down how you will also fall. \n \nCertainly, this world is a house of truth for whoever appreciates \nit, a place of safety for whoever understands it, a house of riches for \nwhoever collects provision from it (for the next world), and a house of \ninstructions for whoever draws instruction from it. It is the place of \nworship for those who love Allah, the place of praying for the angels of \nAllah, the place where the revelation of Allah descends, and the \nmarketing place for those devoted to Allah. Herein, they earned mercy \nand herein they acquired Paradise by way of profit. \n \nTherefore, who can abuse it when it has announced its departure \nand called out that it will leave?! It had given news of its own destruction \nand the death of its people. By its hardship, it set an example of their \nhardships. By its pleasures, it created eagerness for the pleasures (of the \nnext world). It brings ease in the evening and grief in the morning by way \nof persuasion, dissuasion, alarm and warning. People abuse it on the \nmorning of their repentance, but there are others who will praise it on the \nDay of Judgement. The world recalled to them the next life and they bore \nit in mind. It related to them (things of the next life) and they \nacknowledged them. It preached to them and they took lesson \ntherefrom.250\n \n132. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There is an angel of Allah \nwho calls out every day: “Beget children for death! Collect wealth for \ndestruction and raise construction for ruin!” \n \n133. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: This world is a transient \nplace, not a place of stay. The people herein are of two types: One is a \nman who sold away his soul (to his passions) and thus ruined it, and the \nother is a man who purchased his soul (by controlling his desires) and \nfreed it. \n \n134. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A friend is not a friend \nunless he affords protection to his comrade on three occasions: in his \nadversity, in his absence and at the time of his death. \n \n135. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever is bestowed four \nthings is not disallowed four things: whoever is allowed to pray is not \ndeprived of the response to it; whoever is allowed to offer repentance is \nnot deprived of its acceptance; whoever is allowed to seek forgiveness is \nnot deprived of forgiveness, and whoever is allowed to be grateful is not \ndeprived of furtherance of favors. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that this is confirmed by the Book of Allah. \nAbout praying, Allah says, “Call unto Me, I will answer you” (Holy \nQuran, 4: 60). About forgiveness Allah says, “And whoever does evil, or \nwrongs his own self and thereafter seeks Allah’s forgiveness shall find \nAllah oft-Forgiving, most Merciful” (Holy Quran, 4: 110). About \ngratefulness He says, “If you show gratitude, I will increase (my favors) \nto you” (Holy Quran, 14: 7). About repentance He says, “Verily, \n \n250Every speaker and preacher manifests the force of his speech in \nsubjects in which he is well-versed. If he has to change the subject, neither will \nhis mind move, nor will his tongue be able to speak out. But anyone’s intellect \nhas the capability of adaptation: his mind has the power of imagination. It can \nturn round his utterances in whatever manner he likes and can show the \nexcellence of speech on whatever subject he desires. Consequently, when the \ntongue, which had for so long been abusing the world and unveiling its \ndeceitfulness, starts praising the world, it shows the same mastery of speech and \npower of argument which have always been its chief distinction. Then, the use \nof commendatory words does not alter the principle. Although the ways are \ndifferent, the objective remains one and the same. \nrepentance (acceptable) with Allah is only for those who do evil out of \nignorance then turn (to Allah) soon (thereafter); to these, Allah will turn \nmercifully, and Allah is all-Knowing, all-Wise” (Holy Quran, 4: 17). \n \n136. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: For the God-fearing, \nprayers is a means of seeking nearness to Allah, and for the weak, the hajj \nis as good as jihad. For everything there is a tax, and the tax of the body is \nfasting. The jihad of a woman is to afford pleasant company to her \nhusband.\n \n137. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Seek livelihood by giving \nalms. \n \n138. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever is sure of a good \nreturn is generous in giving. \n \n139. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Assistance is allowed \naccording to need. \n \n140. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever is moderate does \nnot become destitute. \n \n141. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A small family is one of \nthe ways of (securing) ease. \n \n142. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Loving one another is half \nthe measure of wisdom. \n \n143. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Grief is half the old age. \n \n144. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Endurance comes \naccording to affliction. Whoever beats his hand on the thigh in his \naffliction ruins all his good actions. \n \n145. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There are many who fast \nbut whose fast is nothing more than hunger and thirst. There are many \nwho offer of prayers and whose prayer is no better than wakefulness and \nhardship: the sleep as well as the eating and drinking of the intelligent \n(God-fearing) person is far better. \n146. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Protect your belief by \ncharity; guard your wealth by paying Allah’s share thereof, and ward off \nthe waves of calamity by praying. \nImam Ali Ibn Abu Talib’s Conversation with Kumayl Ibn \nZiyad Al-Nakh`I251\nPeople are of three kinds:\n \n147. Kumayl ibn Ziyad has related saying that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) caught hold of his hand and took him to the graveyard. When \nthe Imam (x) had passed through the graveyard and left the city behind, \nhe let a deep sigh and said the following: \n \nO Kumayl these hearts are containers. The best of them is that \nwhich preserves (its contents); so, preserve what I say to you: \n \nPeople are of three types: One is the scholar and the Divine. \nThen, the seeker of knowledge who is also on the way to deliverance. \nThen the common rot who runs after every caller and bends in the \ndirection of every wind. They seek no light from the glory of knowledge \nand do not take protection from any reliable support. \nO Kumayl! Knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge guards \nyou, while you have to guard the wealth. Wealth decreases by spending, \nwhile knowledge multiplies by spending, and the results of wealth die as \nwealth decays. \n \nO Kumayl! Knowledge is belief which is acted upon. With it, \nman acquires obedience during his life and a good name after his death. \nKnowledge is the ruler while wealth is ruled upon. \n \nO Kumayl! Those who amass wealth are dead even though they \nmay be living, while those endowed with knowledge will remain as long \nas the world lives. Their bodies are not available but their figures exist in \n \n251Kumayl ibn Ziyad an-Nakh`i was the holder of the secrets of the \nImamate and one of the most prominent companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x). He held a great status in knowledge and attainment and a chief place in \nabstinence and Godliness. He was Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s Governor of Hit \nfor some time. He was killed by bloody-thirsty al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thawafi \nin the year 83 A.H. (702 A.D.) although he was ninety years old.... He was \nburied outside Kufa. \nthe hearts. Look, here is a heap of knowledge (and Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib [x] pointed to his bosom). I wish I could get someone to bear it. \nYes, I did find (such a person), but either he was one who could not be \nrelied upon, or he was one who exploits the religion for worldly gains \nand, by virtue of Allah’s favors on him, he will dominate the people, and \nthrough Allah’s pleas he will master His devotees. Or he was one who \nwas obedient to the hearers of the truth but there was no intelligence in his \nbosom. At the first appearance of doubt, he will entertain misgivings in \nhis heart. \n \nSo, neither this nor that was good enough. Either the man is eager \nfor pleasures, easily led away by passions, or is covetous for collecting \nand hoarding wealth. Neither of them has any regard for religion in any \nmatter. The nearest example of these is the loose cattle. This is the way \nthat knowledge dies away with the death of its bearers. \n \nO Lord! Yes! Yet the earth is never devoid of those who maintain \nAllah’s plea either openly and reputedly or, being afraid, as hidden in \norder that Allah’s pleas and proofs should not be rebutted. How many are \nthey and where are they? By Allah, they are few in number, but they are \ngreat in esteem before Allah. Through them, Allah guards His pleas and \nproofs till they entrust them to others like themselves and sow the seeds \nthereof in the hearts of those who are like them. \n \nKnowledge has led them to real understanding, so they have \nassociated themselves with the spirit of conviction. They take easy what \nthe easy going regard as hard. They endear what the ignorant take as \nstrange. They live in this world with their bodies here but their spirits \nresting in the high above. They are the vicegerents of Allah on His earth \nand callers to His religion. O, how I yearn to see them! \n \nGo away, O Kumayl, wherever you wish! \n \n 148. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Man is hidden under his \ntongue.252 You cannot know his worth and value. \n \n252The meaning is that a man’s worth can be known by his speech \nbecause the speech of every person is indicative of his mind and manners. By \nvirtue of it, his feelings and temperament can be very easily assessed. Therefore, \nso long as he is silent, his weakness as well as attainments are concealed, but \nwhen he speaks, his real self manifests itself. \nMan is hidden under his tongue... unless he speaks, \n149. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever does not know \nhis own worth is ruined. \n \nOn Preaching\n \n150. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following to a man who \nhad requested him to preach: Do not be like him who hopes for (bliss in) \nthe next life without action and delays repentance by prolonging his \ndesires, who utters words like ascetics in this world but whose deeds are \nlike those who are eager for it. If he is granted something of it, he does \nnot feel satisfied. If he is denied, he is not content. He is not grateful for \nwhat he gets and covets an increase in whatever remains with him. He \ncurbs others (from wrongdoing) but not his own self. He commands \nothers for what he himself does not do. He loves the virtuous but does not \nbehave like them. He hates the vicious but he himself is one of them. He \ndislikes death because of the excess of his sins but adheres to that because \nof which he is afraid of death. \n \nIf he falls ill, he feels ashamed: if he is healthy, he feels secure \nand indulges in amusements. When he recovers from illness, he feels vain \nabout himself. When he is afflicted, he loses hope. If distress befalls him, \nhe prays like a bewildered man. When he finds ease of life, he falls into \ndeceit and turns his face away. His heart overpowers him by means of \nimaginary things while he cannot control his heart by his conviction. For \nothers, he is afraid of small sins, but for himself, he expects more rewards \nthan his performance. If he becomes wealthy, he becomes self-conscious \nand falls into vice. If he is impoverished, he despairs and becomes weak. \nHe is brief when he is doing a good thing but goes too far when he is \nbegging. When passion overtakes him, he is quick in committing sin but \ndelays repentance. If hardship befalls him, he goes beyond the canons of \nthe (Islamic) community. He describes instructive events but does not \ntake instruction himself. He preaches at length but does not accept any \npreaching for himself. He is tall on speech but short on action. He aspires \nfor things that will perish and ignores things that will last for good. He \nregards profit as loss and loss as profit. He fears death but does nothing in \nits anticipation. \n \nHe regards the sins of others as big but considers the same things \nfor himself as small. If he does something in obedience to Allah, he \nconsiders it much, but if others do the same, he considers it small. He, \ntherefore, rebukes others but flatters himself. Entertainment in the \ncompany of the wealthy is dearer to him than remembrance (of Allah) \nwith the poor; he passes verdicts against others for his own interests and \ndoes not do so against himself for others’ interests. He guides others but \nmisguides himself. He is obeyed by others but he himself disobeys \n(Allah). He seeks the fulfillment of obligations (to himself) but does not \nfulfil his own obligations (towards others). He fears the people (and \ndeeds) for others besides his Lord (Allah) and does not fear his Lord in \ndealing with the public. \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says that if this book had contained nothing save \nthis short statement, it will have sufficed as a successful piece of \npreaching, a specimen of high philosophy, an objective of wisdom for the \nonlooker and a source of instruction for the meditative onlooker. \n \n151. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Every human being has to \nmeet the end, sweet or sour. \n \n152. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Every comer has to return, \nand after returning, it is as though he never existed. \n \n153. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The one who endures does \nnot miss success although it may take a long time. \n \n154. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever agrees with the \naction of a group of persons is as though he joins them in that action. And \neveryone who joins in wrong commits two sins: one sin for committing \nthe wrong and the other for agreeing with it. \n \n155. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Adhere to your covenants \nand entrust their fulfillment to steadfast persons. \n \n156. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: On you lies (the obligation \nof) obedience to the person about whom you cannot plead the excuse of \nignorance.253But it will ever remain on the oppressor. \n \n253Just as Allah sent down a series of prophets by way of His justice \nand mercy to guide and direct us towards a perfect life and even a better \nhereafter, in the same way, He laid down the system of the Imamate to protect \nthe creed from alteration so that every Imam may in his time save the Divine \nteachings from the onslaught of personal desires and give directions about the \ncorrect principles of Islam. And just as it is obligatory to know the originator of \n157. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Your minds are opened \nwhen you see, and you are guided when you receive guidance, and you \nare made to hear when you do hear. \n \n158. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Remonstrate with your \nbrother by being kind to him, and respond to his evil by being generous to \nhim. \n \n159. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If one places himself \nwhere he may be charged, let him not blame those who may think ill of \nhim. \n \n160. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who possesses prefers \nhimself over others. \n \n161. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who follows only his \nview perishes, and one who consults with others shares their wisdom \n \n162. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who hides his secret \nholds his own option,. \n \n163. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Poverty is the greatest \ndeath.\n \n164. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If one is fair to another \nwho is not fair to him, it is as though he worships him. \n \nthe religion (i.e. the Prophet [k]), in the same way, it is necessary to know the \nprotector of the religion. Whoever remains ignorant of him cannot be excused \nbecause the issue of Imamate is supported by so many proofs and testimonies \nthat no intelligent person can find any way to deny it. Thus, the Holy Prophet \n(k) has said, “Whoever dies without knowing the Imam of his times dies the \ndeath of jahiliyya, the period of ignorance and oppression. One’s life-span is \nlimited, but the punishment for oppression is Hell. Its most fearful aspect is that \nlife there will last forever, without an end, and there will be no death for one to \nbe spared its punishment. This is why, if an oppressor kills someone, with such \nkilling, the oppression terminates, and there is no further scope for any further \noppression on the same person. A Persian couplet says: \nThe effect of oppression on us has passed away, \n165. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: No creature should be \nobeyed so long as such obedience means disobedience of the Creator. \n \n166. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: No blame should be placed \non one in delaying taking what belongs to him; blame should be on one \nwho takes what does not belong to him. \n \n167. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Conceit stops one from \nseeking perfection. \n \n168. The undertaking is near, but company is not. \n \n169. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Morning surely shines for \nthose who have vision. \n \n170. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Abandoning a sin is easier \nthan seeking help. \n \n171. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: How often one meal \nblocks many! \n \n172. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: People are enemies of \nwhat they do not know. \n \n173. One who welcomes various views gets to know where error \nlies.\n \n174. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who sharpens his \nweapon seeking revenge against those who incur the Wrath of Allah will \nbe strong enough to kill those who are strong in committing falsehood. \n \n175. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If you fear doing \nsomething, then do it because your fear is greater than the deed itself. \n \n176. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The mechanism whereby \none earns mastership is forbearance. \n \n177. Reprimand the evil doer by rewarding the doer of righteous-\nness.\n178. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Remove evil from the \nchest of others by eradicating it from your own. \n \n179. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Fanatically insisting on \ndisagreeing poisons one’s view. \n \n180. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Greed is perpetual \nbondage.\n \n181. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The fruit of carelessness is \nregret, whereas the fruit of determination is safety. \n \n182. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Preferring silence over \narticulating wisdom produces nothing good; likewise is to speak out of \nignorance.\n \n183. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: No two cases vary from \neach other except that one of them is falsehood. \n \n184. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Never have I ever doubted \nthe truth whenever it was shown to me. \n \n185. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Never have I told a lie, nor \nwas I ever called a liar. Never did I ever stray, nor could any use me to \ncause others to stray. \n \n186. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The oppressor who starts \nthe oppression will tomorrow bite his hand (in regret). \n \n187. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Departure (from this \nworld) is nigh. \n \n188. One who openly opposes what is right perishes. \n \n189. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who is not saved by \npatience will be finished by impatience. \n \n190. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: How strange! Should \ncaliphate be obtained through friends and relatives?! \nAl-Shareef al-Radi, for whom verses of poetry are narrated, has \nsaid a couple of lines the gist of which is as follows: \n \nIf you through shura took charge of them, \n \nHow so since those whose advice is to be sought were absent?! \n \nAnd if you through kinsfolk argued with the opponent, \n \nOthers are more worthy of and nearer than you to the Prophet. \n \n191. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One in this life is a target \nof death, a loot to calamities. With every sip there is hardship, with every \nmorsel there is pain. Whenever a servant of Allah receives a blessing, he \nbids farewell to another. Whenever he welcomes a new day, he bids \nfarewell for its sake to another. This is so because we are assistants of the \nfates: Every breath we draw is a target of death; so, how can we hope to \nlast since this night and this day never raise anything in honor except that \nthey are more swift in destroying what they build and scatter what they \ngather?\n \n192. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: O son of Adam! Anything \nyou earn beyond your need is stored for others. \n \n193. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Hearts have desires, \ncoming or going; so, approach your hearts according to their desires and \napproaches, for if you force the heart, you will blind it. \n \n194. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: What shall I satisfy my \nanger when I am enraged? Is it when I am unable to seek revenge, so it \nwill be said to me: “Why did you not have patience?” Or should I do it \nwhen I am able, so it will be said to me: “Why did you not forgive?”! \n \n195. Passing by some garbage, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: \nThis is some people were too miser to give others. \n \nIn another narrative, he is reported as having said, “This is what \nyou used to compete with each other for!” \n \n196. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: None of your wealth was \nwasted so long as it provided you with admonishment. \n \n197. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: These hearts wear out just \nas bodies wear out; so, seek for them beautiful pieces of wisdom \n198. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), having heard the Kharijites \nsay, “There is no government except Allah’s”, said: “A true statement \nintended to reap falsehood.” \n \n199. Describing the mobs, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: \nThey are the ones who overwhelm when they gather and who are known \nwhen they disperse. It is said that he, peace be upon him, rather said, \n“They are the ones who do harm when they gather and they do good when \nthey disperse.” The Imam (x) was asked, “When understand their \nmischief when they gather, but what is the benefit when they disperse?” \nThe Imam (x) said, “Each one of them returns to his profession, so people \nbenefit from them, such as the builder returning to build, the weaver \nreturns to his craft and the baker returns to his bakery, and so on.” \n \n 200. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following when a \ncriminal was brought to him escorted by mobs: There is no welcome for \nyou here, O faces that are not seen except when a bad deed is committed. \n \n201. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: With every human being, \nthere are two guardian angels. When fate comes, they make room for him; \nfate is a secure protection.. \n \n202. Talhah and az-Zubair said to the Imam (x), “We shall swear \nthe oath of allegiance to you provided we are your prtners in this matter \n(in caliphate).” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: No, but you both are \npartners when strength and aid are sought, and you both are aides against \ninability and extreme effort. \n \n203. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: O people! Fear Allah Who \nhears you when you speak, Who knows what you hide in your breasts, \nand be more swift than death which catches up with you when you flee, \nwhich take you when you stay, and which remembers you when you \nforget about it. \n \n204. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do not be discouraged by \ningrates from doing good deeds, for you may be thanked by those who do \nnot benefit from your good deed and who still are grateful to you for it. \nYou may obtain gratitude from a grateful person much more than what \nsomeone who hides it has wasted, “... and Allah loves the doers of \nrighteousness.”\n205 Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Every container becomes \nstraitened by what is put in it except the container of knowledge: It \nexpands.\n \n206. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The first compensation for \na clement person for his clemency is that people are his supporters against \nthe ignorant ones. \n \n207. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If you are not clement, \nthen put on the garb of clemency, for many are those who imitate others \nand who become almost just like them. \n \n208. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who holds himself to \naccount succeeds. When who overlooks it loses. One who is cautious \nearns security. One who receives admonishment expands his vision. One \nwho expands his vision gains understanding, and who gains \nunderstanding earns knowledge. \n \n209. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The life of this world shall \nbe kind to us after being cruel to us just as a she-camel that rejects those \nwho milk it but turns with affection to its newborn. Having said so, the \nImam (x) recited the following verse: “And We wished to be gracious to \nthose who were being oppressed in the land, to make them leaders (in \nfaith) and to make them heirs” (Quran, 28:5). \n \n210. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Fear Allah like one who is \nwilling to risk everything [just to please Allah], who urges himself to \nwalk towards Allah, who starts in awe, who looks into the outcomes of \nmatters, into the penalty of anything forbidden, who is apprehensive of \nthe final end. \n \n211. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Generosity is the guard of \nhonors. Clemency is ship’s restrainer. Forgiveness is the zakat of victory. \nSolace is your compensation for one who betrayed you. Consultation is \nthe same as guidance. One who sticks only to his own view takes a risk. \nPatience struggles against calamities. Impatience aids against time’s \nfluctuations. The best of wealth is to abandon high hopes. How many are \nthe minds that are subdued by aggressive desires! A sign of success is to \nremember experience. Affection is a useful kinship. And do not place \nyour trust in someone who has no patience. \n212. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One’s self-conceit is one \nof the envies of his own mind. \n \n213. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Overlook imperfections \nand pains and you will always be pleased. \n \n214. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One whose stem is lean, \nhis leaves will be thick. (That is, one who is kind to others will grow in \nhealth.)\n \n215. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Disputes destroy views. \n \n216. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who wins becomes \ngreater.\n \n217. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: In the alterations of \nconditions lies the knowledge of the gems of men. \n \n218. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Envying a friend is a sign \nof fault in one’s friendship. \n \n219. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Most places where minds \nare conquered fall under the glitter of high hopes. \n \n220. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: It is not fair to put an end \nto trust by entertaining doubt. \n \n221. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: How miserable the ration \nof a servant of Allah to the Hereafter is if he oppresses Allah’s servants! \n \n222. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The very best of a \ngenerous man’s acts of generosity is that he is mindless of what he knows \n(of people’s faults). \n \n223. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who is attired with the \noutfit of modesty, people never see his fault. \n \n224. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Through abundance of \nsilence does one earn respect. Through fairness does one win lovers. \nThrough acts of favors does one’s value get greater. Through humility \ndoes one’s blessing become complete. Through bearing hardships, \nloftiness is earned. Through fair dealing, an opponent is subdued. And \nthrough clemency with regard to a shallow-minded person does one earn \nsupporters.\n \n225. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: How strange it is that the \nenvious ones overlook the soundness of their own bodies! \n \n226. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A covetous person is tied \nwith the ropes of humiliation. \n \n227. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked about iman. He said: \nIman is a knowledge with the heart, an admission with the tongue, and an \naction according to the [Islamic] injunctions. \n \n228. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If one becomes sad about \nthis world, he becomes angry with what Allah decrees. One who \ncomplains about a calamity that befell him, he complains against his \nLord. And one who goes to a wealthy man and humbles himself to him on \naccount of his wealth wipes out two-thirds of his creed. If one recites the \nQur’an, and when he dies he goes to hell, he is one of those who used to \nmock the Signs of Allah. If one keeps talking about his love for this \nworld, his heart will be burnt by it in three instances: a worry which he \nnever overcomes, a miserliness which never abandons him, and a hope \nwhich he never realizes. \n \n229. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Satisfaction suffices for \nwealth and good manners for a bliss. He (x) was asked about the meaning \nof this verse: “... We shall let him lead a good life.” He (x) said, “It (good \nlife) is satisfaction.” \n \n230. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Be partners of one to \nwhom sustenance go for this is the best means for acquiring wealth and \nthe most worthy of earning a good luck. \n \n231. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following in \nexplanation of the verse saying, “Allah enjoins you to abide by justice and \nkindness”: Justice means equity, while kindness is doing others favors. \n232. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If one gives with the short \nhand, he will be given with the long one. \n \nAl-Radi has said, “The meaning of this statement is that if one \nspends out of his wealth in the way of goodness and kindness, though it \nmay be little, Allah Almighty will make its reward great. The short hand \nhere is a reference to that of the servant of Allah, whereas the long one is \na connotation of the Lord, the most Exalted One, Who is never weakened \nby giving and Who provides with a lot for what is little. \n \n233. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do not invite anyone to a \nduel, but if you are called upon to duel, respond, because one who calls to \na duel is an oppressor, and the oppressor is always defeated. \n \n234. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The best of women’s \nattributes are the men’s worst: self-conceit, cowardice and miserliness. So \nif a woman is self-conceited, she will not let one approach her (in bed). If \nshe is miser, she safeguards her wealth and that of her husband. And if \nshe is a coward, she is scared of anything displayed before her. \n \n235. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked, “Describe to us the \nwise person.” He (x) said: He is the one who puts everything in its right \nplace. He (x) was then asked to describe the ignorant person, so he said, \n“I have just done so!” \n \nAl-Radi has said, “He means to say that the ignorant person is the \none who does not put things in their right places. He simply is the \nantithesis of the wise person. \n \n236. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: By Allah! Your world is \ncheaper in my eyes than the intestines of a pig in the hands of leper. \n \n237. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Some people worship \nAllah out of their desire (to worship Him). Such is the worship of traders. \nSome people worship Allah out of fear of Him; such is the worship of \nslaves. And some people worship Allah to thank Him; such is the worship \nof the free. \n \n238. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Woman is evil, and the \nworst of her evil is that we cannot do without her! \n239. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who obeys \npostponements loses track of rights. One who obeys a taleteller loses \nfriends.\n \n240. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A rock taken by force in \nthe building of a house is a pawn for its destruction. \n \n241. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The oppressed one’s day \n(of judgment) is to the oppressor much more hard than the day of the \noppressor against the oppressed. \n \n242. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If many answers crowd \ntogether, the truth is hidden. \n \n243. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Fear Allah to some degree \n(even) though it may be little, and set a curtain between you and Allah\n(even) though it may be thin. \n \n244. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When replies are \nnumerous, the correct point remains obscure.254\n \n245. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Surely in every blessing \nthere is a right of Allah. If one carries out that right, Allah increases the \nblessing, and if one falls short of doing so, one stands in danger of losing \nthe blessing. \n \n246. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When capability increases, \ndesire decreases. \n \n247. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Keep on guard against the \nslipping away of blessings because not everything that runs away comes \nback.\n \n254If replies to a question begin to be given from all sides, every reply \nwill raise another question and thus open the door for arguing. And as the \nnumber of replies will further necessitate search for the real truth, detection of \nthe correct reply will become more and more arduous, because everyone will try \nto have his reply accepted as correct as a result of which he will try to collect \narguments from here and there to have his reply accepted as correct. As a result \nof which the whole matter will become confused and this dream will turn into an \naimless one because of the multiplicity of interpretation. \n248. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Generosity is more \nprompting to good than regard for kinship. \n \n249. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If a person has a good idea \nabout you, make his idea come true. \n \n250. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The best deed is that which \nyou have to force yourself to do. \n \n251. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I came to know Allah, the \nGlorified One, through breaking determinations, a change of intentions \nand the loss of courage.255\n \n252. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The sourness of this world \nis the sweetness of the next while the sweetness of this world is the \nsourness of the next. \n \n \n253. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Allah has laid down iman \n(conviction) for purification from polytheism; salat (prayer) for \npurification from vanity; zakat as a means of livelihood; siyam (fasting) \nas a trial of the people; hajj for the honor of Islam; persuasion for good \n(al-amr bil-ma‘ruf) for the good of the common people; dissuasion from \nevil (an-nahy ‘anil-munkar) for controlling the mischievous; regard for \nkinship for increase of number; revenge for stopping bloodshed, the \naward of penalties for the realization of importance of the prohibitions; \nthe abstinence from drinking wine for the protection of one’s wits; the \navoidance of theft for inculcating chastity; the abstinence from adultery \nfor safeguarding lineage; the abstinence from sodomy for increasing the \nprogeny; tendering testimony for furnishing proof against contentions; \nabstinence from telling lies for increasing the esteem of the truth; the \nmaintenance of peace (salam) for the protection from danger; Imamate \n \n255The breaking of determinations and the loss of courage can be \nargued to prove the existence of Allah in this way that, for example, a man \ndetermines to do a thing but before the determination is transformed into action, \nit changes and some other idea takes its place. This alteration of ideas and \ndeterminations and the emergence of change therein is a proof that there is some \nhigher controlling power over us which has the capacity to bring them from non-\nexistence into existence and again from existence into non-existence, and this is \nbeyond human power. Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge a super \nauthority which effects change and alteration in determination. \n(Divine Leadership) for the orderliness of the community and obedience \n(to Imams) as a mark of respect to the Imamate. \n \n \n Before describing some of the aims and good points of the \ncommands of the Shar`a, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) has begun with the \naims and objectives of conviction (iman) because iman serves as the basis \nof religious commands. Without it, no need is felt for any religious code \nor jurisprudence. Iman is acknowledging the existence of the Creator and \nthe admission of His Oneness. When this iman takes root in the heart of a \nman, the latter does not agree to bow before any other being, nor is he \nover-awed or affected by any power or authority. Rather, getting mentally \nfreed of all ties, he regards himself as a devotee of Allah. The result of \nthis adherence to this Unity is that he is saved from the pollution of \npolytheism. \n \n \nPrayer (salat) is the most important of all forms of worship. It \nconsists of standing, sitting, bending and prostrating, and these postures \nare a successful way of destroying the feeling of vanity and pride, erasing \nself-conceit and egotism and creating humility and submissiveness. This \nis so because the actions and movements of a vain person produce pride \nand haughtiness while humble actions engender the quality of \nsubmissiveness and humbleness in the mind. With the exercise of these \ndeeds, a man, by and by, acquires a humble temperament. This is how the \nArabs, who were so vain that if their whip fell off during riding, they \nwould not bend down to pick it up or if the strap of the shoe gave way, \nthey thought it insulting to bend down to mend it..., began to rub their \nfaces on the dust during prostrations in their prayers and place their \nforeheads in the status of others’ feet during congregational prayers. This \nway, they acquired the true spirit of Islam after abandoning the pre-\nIslamic vanity and partisanship. \n \n \nZakat, namely that a person who is financially able to do so \nshould pay annually out of his money or property a fixed share (10%) for \nthose who are either destitute or do not have means of livelihood for a \nyear, is an obligatory command of Islam. The purpose behind it is that no \nindividual in the community should remain poor, and they should all \nremain safe from the evils that result from need and poverty. Besides, \nanother objective is that wealth should keep rotating from one individual \nto another and should not be centered in a few persons. \n \n \nFasting (siyam) is a form of worship in which there is not an iota \nof show, and no motive is active in it except that of pure intention. As a \nresult, even in seclusion, when hunger perturbs a man or thirst makes him \nuneasy, he does not extend his hand for eating, nor does the longing for \nwater make him lose his control although if something is eaten or drunk, \nnone is to peep into his stomach: The purity of conscience prevents his \nwill from deflecting. This is the greatest advantage of fasting: It \nengenders purity of will in action. \n \n \nThe purpose of hajj is that Muslims from all corners of the globe \nshould assemble at one place so that this world assembly should prove to \nbe an occasion for the manifestation of Islam’s greatness, the renewal of \nthe passion for worship and the creation of bonds of mutual brotherhood. \n \n \nThe purpose of jihad is to fight with all possible might and means \nthose forces which oppose Islam, so that Islam may achieve stability and \nprogress. Although there are dangers for life in this course and difficulties \ncrop up at every step, yet the tidings for eternal ease and everlasting life \nproduce the courage to bear all these hardships. \n \n \nThe persuasion for good and dissuasion from evil are effective \nways of showing others the correct path and preventing them from \ncommitting wrongdoings. If a community has no persons to perform these \nduties, nothing can save it from ruin, and it falls to an extreme depth \nmorally and socially. That is why Islam has laid a great emphasis on it as \ncompared to other matters and held disregard to it as an unpardonable sin. \n \n \nDoing good for kinship means that a man should do favors to his \nrelatives. He at least should not stop mutual accosting and speaking with \nthem so that attitudes may become clean and family ties may develop. \nDispersed individuals may render strength to one another. \n \n \nSeeking restitution is a right given to the survivors of the killed \nperson. They can demand a life for a life so that, for fear of punishment, \nnone will dare kill anyone. At the same time, the survivor’s passion for \nrevenge should not result in the killing of more than one single person. No \ndoubt, forgiveness or pardon does carry weight in its own place but where \nit means trampling of an individual’s right or a danger to world peace, it \ncannot be regarded as favorable. Rather, on such an occasion, restitution, \nor the payment of the blood money (diyya), becomes the sole way of \nstopping bloodshed and for the safety of the human life. Thus, Allah says: \n“And for you, there is (security of) restitution (qisas), O men of \nunderstanding, so that you may guard yourselves (against evil)” (Quran, \n2: 179). \nThe purpose behind the awarding of penalties is to make the \noffender appreciate the seriousness of violating the prohibitions of Allah\nso that he may keep off the prohibitions for fear of being punished. \n \n \nWine causes diffusion of thinking, dispersion of senses and \nweakness of comprehension. As a result, a man commits such actions \nwhich will not be expected of him while in the state of his senses being \nweak. Besides, it ruins health and renders the body liable to catch \ninfectious diseases, while sleeplessness, nervous weakness and \nrheumatism are its main side effects. The Shar`a has prohibited it in view \nof these ill effects. \n \n \nTheft, that is, taking what someone else owns, is an evil which is \nproduced by the sway of greed and evil passions. Since bringing down \nevil passions from the status of excess to the bounds of moderation means \nchastity, the abstinence from theft by curbing greed and evil passions will \nproduce it. \n \n \nAdultery and sodomy have been prohibited in order that one’s \nlineage may be regulated and the human race may continue and prosper, \nbecause the issues by adultery are not regarded as legitimate for the \npurposes of lineage. Consequently, they are not entitled to inheritance, \nwhile there is no question of issues in the case of unnatural practices. \nBesides, as a consequence of these evil practices, one may contract such \ndiseases which cause ruination of life in addition to discontinuity of \nprogeny. \n \n \nThe law of testimony is needed because if one party denies the \nright of another party, the latter may establish it through testimony and \nthereby safeguard it. \n \n \nAbstention from lies and falsehood has been commanded so that \nthe standing and importance of its antithesis, namely the truth, may \nbecome prominent. In observing the benefits and the advantages of the \ntruth, the moral weakness of falsehood may be avoided. \n \n \n“Salam” means peace and peace-loving, and it is obvious that a \npeaceful attitude is a successful way of protecting one from dangers and \nfor the prevention of war and fighting. Generally, commentators have \ntaken the word salam to mean “mutual greetings and well-wishing”, but \nthe context and the fact that it has been mentioned in the series of \nobligations does not support this interpretation. However, according to \nthis interpretation, salam is a means of safety from dangers because it is \nregarded as a way of peace and peace-loving. When two Muslims meet \neach other, they offer salam to one another, it means that they announce \nthe wishes of each for the welfare of the other. Afterwards, each feels safe \nwith the other. \n \n \nImamate (imamah): This word has appeared in the same context \nin the authentic editions of Nahjul-Balagha as well as in its commentaries \nlike that of Ibn Abul-Hadd, Vol. 19, p. 90, Ibn Maytham, Vol. 5, pp. 367-\n378; Minhaj al-Bara’ah, Vol. 21, p. 318, and other sources besides \nNahjul-Balagha such as Nihayat al-‘Arab by an-Nuwayri ash-Shafi‘i, Vol. \n8, p. 183 and Bihar al-Anwar by al-Majlisi, Vol. 6, p. 111. \n \n \nIn fact, this word, “imamah”, has been distorted to “amanah” \n(trust) or “amanat” (trusts) in some copies such as those printed in Egypt. \nIt is very surprising to note that the word has appeared as amanah in the \ntext of Nahjul-Balagha printed with a commentary by Ibn Abul-Hadid in \nEgypt in the first edition, Vol. 4, p. 350 as well as in the second edition \nedited by Muhammad Abul-Fadhl Ibrahim, Vol. 19, p. 86, while he \nhimself (Ibn Abul-Hadid) based his commentary on its correct reading, \nnamely imamah as did other commentators. \n \n \nHowever, in explanation of this sentence, “Imamate for the \norderliness of the community,” as the theological scholars say: Whoever \nhas known dark experiences and has examined political principles knows, \nout of necessity, that whenever men have among them a chief and a guide \nwhom they obey, one who restrains the oppressor from his oppression and \nthe unjust man from his injustice and avenges the oppressed of his \noppressor, and along with that leads them to rational principles and \nreligious duties and restrains them from the corruption which causes the \ndestruction of order in their worldly affairs and from the evils which \nresult in wretchedness in the world to come, so that every individual \nmight fear that punishment..., then because of all of this, they will draw \nnear to soundness and depart from corruption (Ch. 11, English translation, \np. 63). \n \n \nThe institution of Imamate is intended to cater for the unification \nof the nation and to protect the commandments of Islam from alteration \nand change. In the absence of a head for the nation and a protector for the \nreligion, the order of the nation cannot be maintained, nor can the \ncommandments of Islam remain safe from interference by others. This \nobjective can be achieved only when obedience to him is obligatory on \nthe people. This is so because if he is not obeyed and followed by \nobligation, he will neither be able to maintain justice and equity, nor \nsecure the rights of the oppressed from the oppressor, nor issue and \nenforce the laws of the Shari`a and consequently the extinction of evil and \nmischief from the land cannot be expected. \n \n \n254. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) used to say: If you want an \noppressor to take an oath, ask him to swear like this: that he is out of \nAllah’s might and power, because if he swears falsely in this way, he will \nbe swiftly punished while if he swears by Allah Who is such that there is \nno god but He, he will not be quickly punished since he is acknowledging \nthe Unity of Allah, the Sublime.256\n \n \n255. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib(x) said: O son of Adam! Be your \nown representative in the matter of your property, and do about it \n \n256It is narrated that someone levied some charges against Imam Ja‘far \nas-Sadiq (x) before the ‘Abbaside caliph ‘Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Mansur. \nAl-Mansur sent for the Imam and told him that such-and-such a person had told \nhim such-and-such about him. The Imam said it was all wrong and there was not \nan iota of truth in it. He desired the man to be sent for and questioned before \nhim. Consequently, he was sent for and questioned. He said that whatever he \nhad said was true and correct. The Imam said to him, “If you are speaking the \ntruth, then you swear as I ask you to swear.” Thereafter, the Imam (x) made him \nswear by saying, “I am out of Allah’s might and power and I rely on my own \nmight and power.” Soon after swearing like this, the man was attacked with \nparalysis and he became motionless. The Imam, returned with full honor and \nprestige (Al-Kafi, al-Kulayni, Vol. 6, pp. 445-446; Bihar al-Anwar, Vol. 47, pp. \n164-165, 172-175, 203-204; Al-Fusul al-Muhimmah, Ibn as-Sabbagh al-Maliki, \npp. 225-226; As-Sawa‘iq al-Muhriqah, Ibn Hajar ash-Shafi‘i, p. 120; Jami‘\nKaramat al-Awliya’, an-Nabhani ash-Shafi‘i, Vol. 2, p. 4). Such an event took \nplace during the reign of Harun ar-Rashid (149/766-193/809 grandson of al-\nMansur) when ‘Abdullah ibn Mus‘ab (grandson of ‘Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, the \nwell-known enemy of Ahl al-Bayt (x) of the Holy Prophet) slandered Yahya ibn \n‘Abdallah ibn al-Hassan ibn (al-Imam) al-Hassan ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib before \nHarun ar-Rashid by saying that he was plotting a revolution against him \n(Harun). Then Yahya made ‘Abdullah swear before Harun in the same manner \nas the Imam had done. When ‘Abdullah swore as he was required to, the \nsymptom of leprosy soon appeared in him in the presence of Harun and he died \nafter three days, while every part of his flesh cracked open and all the hair of his \nbody fell out. After this, Harun used to say, “How soon Allah took revenge on \n‘Abdulln ah for Yahya!” (Maqatil at-Talibiyyin, Abul-Faraj al-Isfahani, pp. 472-\n478; Muruj al-Dhahab, al-Mas‘udi, Vol. 3, pp. 340-342; Tarikh Baghdad, al-\nKhatib, Vol. 14, pp. 110-112; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 19, pp. 91-94; At-Tarikh,\nIbn Kathir, Vol. 10, pp. 167-168; Tarikh al-Khulafa’, al-Sayyuti, p. 287).\nwhatever you want to be done with it after your death.257Since after you, it \nwill be out of your control. \n \n \n256. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Anger is a kind of \nmadness because the victim to it repents afterwards. If he does not repent \nhis madness is confirmed. \n \n \n257. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Health of body comes \nfrom paucity of envy.258\n \n \n258. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following to Kumayl \nibn Ziyad an-Nakha‘i: O Kumayl! Direct your people to go out in the day \nto achieve noble traits and to go out in the night to meet the needs of those \nwho might be sleeping, for I swear by the One Whose hearing extends to \nall voices, if someone pleases another’s heart, Allah will create a special \nthing out of this pleasing so that whenever any hardship befalls him, it \nwill come running like flowing water and drive away the hardship as wild \ncamels are driven away. \n \n \n259. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When you fall in \ndestitution, trade with Allah through charity. \n \n \n260. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Faithfulness with faithless \npeople is faithlessness with Allah, while faithlessness with faithless \npeople is faithfulness with Allah.\n \n \n261. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There is many a man being \ngradually brought towards punishment by good treatment with him; many \na man who remains in deceit because his evils are covered, and many a \n \n257The meaning of it is that if a person desires that after his death a \nportion of his property should be spent on charity, he should not wait till the \ntime of his death but should spend it wherever he desires even during his \nlifetime. It is possible that after his death, his successors may not act upon his \nwill or he may not get an opportunity to write a will. A Persian couplet says: \nGive away money and property while you are living, \n258Envy produces such a poisonous matter in the body which destroys \nthe natural heat of the body. As a result, the body weakens and the spirit withers. \nThis is why an envious person never prospers and melts away in the heat of \nenvy. \nman who is in illusion because of good talk about him, while there is no \ngreater ordeal by Allah, the Glorified One, than the giving of time. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “This saying has appeared earlier as well but \nhere it contains a beautiful and useful addition.” \n \n \nSection where we have included selections from wonderful \nsayings of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) which require explanations: \n \n \n262-1. A tradition related from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: \nWhen the situation is like this, then the head of the religion will rise and \npeople will gather around him as pieces of rainless cloud gather during \nautumn... \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “ya`sub”259 is the great chief who is in \ncharge of the people’s affairs, and “quza” means the pieces of cloud \nwhich have no rain. \n \n259“Ya`sub” [which exists in the original Arabic text] is the name given \nto the queen bee, and the saying of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is: ”fa idha kana \ndhalika daraba ya`subu’d-din bi dhanabihi”. The word “daraba” means to beat, \nstrike, hit, etc.; “ya`subu’d-din” means “the head of religion and of the Shar`a”, \nand “dhanab” means tail, end, adherent or flower. In this sentence, “ya`subu’d-\ndin” stands for the Present Imam (Imam al-Mahdi [Oy]). Although this title was \ngiven by the Holy Prophet to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) specifically, as he \nsaid, “O Ali! You are the ya‘sub (head) of the believers while wealth is the \nya‘sub of the hypocrites” (Al-Isti‘ab, Vol. 4, p. 1744; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. 5, p. \n287; Al-Isabah, Vol. 4, p. 171; Ar-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 2, p. 155; Majma‘ az-\nZawa’id, Vol. 9, p. 102; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 1, p. 12; Vol. 19, p. 22). Also, the \nHoly Prophet said to Ali: “You are the ya‘sub of the religion” (Ar-Riyad an-\nNadirah, Vol. 2, p. 177; Taj al-‘Arus, Vol. 1, p. 381; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 1, p. \n12; Vol. 19, p. 224). Also, the Holy Prophet said to Ali: “You are the ya‘sub of \nthe Muslims (Yanabi‘ al-Mawaddah, al-Qunduzi, p. 62). Again the Holy \nProphet said: “You are the ya‘sub of Quraysh” (Al-Maqasid al-Hassanah, as-\nSakhawi, p. 94). Therefore, the reason for giving the Imam this name is that just \nas the queen bee is pure alone and in the society of other bees, collecting her \nnectar from the blossoms and flowers, keeping away from pollution, in the same \nway, the present Imam (Oy) is free from all pollution and is perfectly clean and \npure. This saying has been interpreted in several ways: Firstly, it means that \n“When the present Imam (Oy) settles at his seat after his tour and rotation around \nthe world, people will gather around him.” Secondly, it means that “When the \nImam (Oy) moves about on earth along with his friends and associates...” In this \ncase the word “daraba” will mean moving about, and the word “dhanab” will \nmean helpers and associates. Thirdly, it means that “when the Imam rises with a \n263-2. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: He is a \nversatile speaker.260\n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “Ashahshah” means one expert and free in \nspeech, and everyone who is free in speech or in walking is called \n“Ashahshah”, while in another sense this word means a miserly and \nniggardly person. \n \n \n264-3. A tradition from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: \nQuarrels bring about ruin. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “Quhm” means “ruin” because quarrels \noften drive men into ruin and grief. In the same way, it is said “quhmatul-\nA`rub” which means the period (of drought) when the cattle owned by the \nnomad desert Arabs are reduced to bones. Another argument is also \nadvanced in this matter, namely that the situation drives them to green \nareas. In other words, the hardship of the desert life drives them to hadar \n(metropolis area, a more sophisticated and complex living environment \nthan that wherein nomads of the desert live). \n \n \n265-4. A tradition from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: When \ngirls come of age, relatives on the father’s side are preferable. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says, “Instead of ‘nassa’l-hiqaq’, the combination \nof ‘nassa’l-haqa’iq’ has also been related.” “Nass” means the last end of \nthings or their most remote limit, such as “an-nassi fi’ssayr” means the \nmaximum a beast can walk. Or you say “nasastur-rajula anil-amri” when \nyou have questioned a man to the extreme to make him utter all that he \nhas. Thus, “nassul-haqa’iq” means prudence because it is the last limit of \nchildhood and is the time when a child crosses childhood into maturity. \nThis is a very eloquent reference to the point, and a strange one, too. \n \nsword in hand...” In this case the word “dhanab” will mean stinging by the bee. \nFourthly, it means that “When the Imam rises for the propagation of the true \nfaith with full fervor...” In this case, the sentence is suggestive of the state of \nanger and the posture to attack. \n260The reference about the “versatile speaker” is to Sa‘sa‘ah ibn Suhan \nal-‘Abdi who was among the chief companions of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x). \nThis saying throws light on the greatness of his speaking ability and the force of \nhis utterances. In this regard, Ibn Abul-Hadid has written the following: “It \nsuffices Sa‘sa‘ah’s greatness that a personality like Ali (x) has praised him for \nversatility and eloquence of speech” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 19, p. 106). \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) intends to say: “When girls reach this stage, \ntheir relatives on the father’s side have a better right [to marry them] than \ntheir mother, provided they are those with whom marriage is not \nprohibited, such as brothers and uncles, etc., to arrange for their marriages \nif they so desire. “Al-hiqaq” also means the quarreling of the mother with \na girl’s paternal relatives. This quarrel is that everyone of them says he \nhas a better right for her. That is why it is said “haqatuhu hiqaqan” on the \nlines of “jadaltuhu jidalan”. It has also been said that “nassul-hiqaq” \nmeans acquiring understanding. This is prudence, too, because Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) refers to the stage when rights and duties become \napplicable. The person who has related the word as “haqa’iq” intends to \nsignify the plural of “haqiqah” (reality, fact, truth). \n \n \nThe above is what Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam has stated \n(in Gharib al-Hadith, Vol. 3, pp. 456-458); but I think that what is meant \nhere by the word “nassul-hiqaq” is a girl’s reaching the stage when it is \npossible to marry her and allow her to dispose of her rights herself on the \nanalogy of “bil hiqaqi mina’l-ibili” (a camel’s attaining majority) wherein \n“hiqaq” is the plural of “hiqqah” or “hiqq”; it means completion of three \nyears and entry into the fourth, which is the time when it reaches the age \nwhen it is possible to ride on its back. “Haqa’iq”, too, is the plural of \n“hiqqah”. Thus, both the versions point to the same meaning, and this \ninterpretation is more in keeping with the way of the Arabs than the other \none stated earlier. \n \n \n266-5. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: Faith \nproduces a “Alumazah” in the heart. As faith develops, “Alumazah” also \nincreases. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “Alumazah” is a white spot, or something \nlike that. On that analogy, if a horse has a white spot on its lower lip, it is \ncalled “farusun al-mazu”, that is, a white-spotted horse. \n \n \n267-6. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: If a man \nhas “ad-daynu’z-zanun” (i.e. doubtful loan), it is his duty to pay zakat \nthereon for all the past years when he recovers it. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “Az-zanun” is the loan about which the \nlender does not know whether he will be able to recover it from the \nborrower or not. He is like the one who hopes as well as loses hope. This \nis the most eloquent way of expression. In this way, everything about \nwhich you do not know where you stand will be zanun. In the same strain, \nthe poet al-Aisha (Maymun ibn Qays al-Wa’ili [d. 7/629]) says, “The az-\nzanun well (i.e. the one that may or may not have water), which is also \ndeprived of the rain of the clouds and cannot be compared to the \nEuphrates whose waves are rising high and which ever pushes the boat \naway on its current as it does the adept swimmer.” \n \n \n“Jubb” means “ well” (located in a wilderness), while zanun is \nthat about which it is not known whether or not it has water. \n \n \n268-7. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) relates that he \narranged a force for advancing for jihad and said: i’dhibu (turn away) \nfrom women as far as you can. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: It (“i‘dhibu”) means “stay away” from \nthoughts of women and from clinging your heart to them, and do not have \nunion with them, because all this produces weakness in enthusiasm, \naffects the firmness of determination, weakens one against his enemy and \nprevents one from excelling in fighting. Anything which prevents from \nsomething is called “adhaba ‘anhu” i.e. turned away from it. Thus, “al-\n‘adhib” and “al-adhub” mean one who gives up eating and drinking. \n \n \n269-8. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) says: ... Like \nthe successful shooter (al-yasir al-falij) who looks forward to achieving \nsuccess at his first shot. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “Al-yasirun” (pl. of al-yasir) means those \nwho shoot with arrows on the slaughtered camel by way of gambling, \nwhile “al-falij” means successful or victorious. For example, it is said: \n“falaja `alayhim” or “falajahum” (that is, he got victory over them or \noverpowered them). A poet has said by way of war this recital: “When I \nnoticed a successful person securing victory..., etc.” \n \n \n270-9. A tradition of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) runs as follows: \nWhen the crisis became red-hot, we sought refuge with the Messenger of \nAllah (k), and none of us was closer to the enemy than he himself was. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “This means that when fear of the enemy \nincreased and fighting became serious, the Muslims begin to think that \nsince the Messenger of Allah had taken up fighting himself, Allah must \ngive them victory through him and that, therefore, they will be safe from \nall the dangers because of his presence.” \nAnd the words “idha’hmarra’l-ba’su” (when the crisis became \nred-hot) refers to the seriousness of the matter. For this purpose, several \nexpressions have been used out of which this is the best, since Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) has likened war with fire which combines heat and \nredness both in action as well as in color. This is confirmed by the words \nof the Messenger of Allah (k) when during the battle of Hunayn, he \nnoticed the people of Hawazin (tribe) fighting, he said: “Now the watis \nhas heated up” and watis is the place where fire is lighted. In this way, \nthe Messenger of Allah (k) likened the seriousness of fighting by men to \nthe seriousness of the fire and its flames. \nThis section ends and we return to the original theme of the \nchapter.\n \n \n271. When the news of the attack of Mu`awiyah’s men on al-\nAnbar reached Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), he himself came out walking \ntill he reached an-Nukhaylah where people overtook him and said: “O \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib! We are [mighty] enough for [defeating] them.” \nHe said: You cannot be enough for me against yourselves, so how can \nyou be enough for me against others? Before me, the people used to \ncomplain of the oppression of their rulers, but now I have to complain of \nthe wrongful actions of my people; as though I am led by them and they \nare the leaders, or that I am the subject and they are the rulers. \n \n \nThe narrator says: “When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) uttered this \nduring his long speech, which we have included in the collection of \nsermons (No. 27), two men from among his companions advanced \ntowards him and one of them said: “‘I rule none except myself and my \nbrother’ (Quran, 5: 25). So, order us with your command, O Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib and we will carry it out.” Thereupon, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) said: “How can you two accomplish what I aim at?” \n \n \n272. It is said that al-Harith ibn Hawt came to Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib and said: “Do you believe that I can ever imagine that the people of \nJamal were wrong?” Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: “O al-Harith! You \nhave seen below yourself but not above yourself, so you have been \nconfused. Certainly, you have known right, so that you can recognize the \nrighteous. And you have not known wrong, so that you can recognize the \npeople who are wrong!” Then al-Harith said: “In that case, I shall \nwithdraw along with Sa‘d ibn Malik261 and ‘Abdullah ibn Umar,” \nwhereupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: “Verily, Sa‘d and `Umar \nhave neither sided with right nor forsaken wrong.”1\n \n \n273. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: One who holds authority is \nlike one who rides a lion; he is envied for his status but he well knows \nit.262\n \n \n274. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do good with the bereaved \nones of others so that good is done to your bereaved ones, too. \n \n261Sa‘d ibn Malik (i.e. Sa‘d ibn Abu Waqqas, father of `Umar ibn Sa‘d \nwho killed Imam Hussain [x]) and Abdullah ibn `Umar were among those who \nwere keeping themselves away from Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib’s help and \nsupport. As for Sa‘d ibn Abu Waqqas, after the killing of Othman he retired to \nsome wilderness and passed his life there, but did not agree to swear the oath of \nallegiance to Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) (as caliph). But after the death of \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib he used to express his repentance, saying, “I held an \nopinion but it was a wrong opinion.” (Al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, Vol. 3, p. 116). \nAnd when Mu`awiyah blamed him for not supporting him in his fight with \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib, Sa‘d said: I only repent for not having fought against \nthe rebellious group (i.e. Mu`awiyah and his folks). (Ahkam al-Quran, al-Jassas \nal-Hanafi, Vol. 2, pp. 224, 225; Al-Furu‘, Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali, Vol. 3, p. 542). \nAs for ‘Abdullah ibn Umar, although he had sworn allegiance, he refused to \nhelp Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) in his battles putting forth this excuse: “I have \nsought seclusion to devote myself to worship and do not, therefore, want to \ninvolve myself in war and fighting.” A Persian couplet says that intelligence \nregards such excuses to be worse than the offence itself. “Abdullah ibn `Umar \nalso frequently used to express his repentance, even up to the last moments of \nhis life, saying: I do not find anything in myself to be distressed about in this \nworld, except my not having fought alongside Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) against the \nrebellious group as Allah, to Whom belongs Might and Majesty, had \ncommanded me (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, pp. 115-116; Al-Sunan al-Kubra, al-\nBayhaqi, Vol. 8, p. 172; Al-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa‘d, Vol. 4, part 1, pp. 136, 137; Al-\nIsti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 953; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. 3, p. 229; Vol. 4, p. 33; Majma‘ az-\nZawa’id, Vol. 3, p. 182; Vol. 7, p. 242; Al-Furu‘, Vol. 3, p. 543; Ruh al-Ma‘ani,\nal-Alusi, Vol. 26, p. 151). \n262The notion here is that if a person holds a high position in, say, a \nroyal court, people look at his rank, status, honor and prestige with envy. But he \nhimself has always the fear lest the royal pleasure should turn against him and \nhe falls in the pit of disgrace and dishonor or death and destruction. He is like \nthe rider on a lion with whom people are awed, but he himself ever faces the \ndanger lest the lion should devour him or throw him in some fatal pit. \n275. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When the utterance of the \nwise is to the point, it serves as a cure, but if it is wrong, it acts like an \nillness.263\n \n \n276. Someone asked Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to define \nreligion for him. The Imam said, “Come to me tomorrow so that I may \nenlighten you in the presence of all people; thus, if you forget what I say, \nothers might retain it. This is so because an utterance is like a fluttering \nprey which may be grappled by someone but missed by others.” \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says, “We have already stated in the earlier \nchapter how Imam Ali ibn AbÅ Talib replied to this man, namely his \nsaying (No. 31): ‘Faith stands on four pillars, etc.’” \n \n \n277. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: O son of Adam! Do not \ninflict the worry of the day that has not yet come on the day which has \nalready come because if that day is in your life, Allah will also bestow its \nlivelihood.\n \n \n278. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Have love for your friend \nup to a limit, for it is possible that he may turn into your enemy some day. \nAnd hate your enemy up to a limit, for it is possible that he may turn into \nyour friend some day. \n \n \n279. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: There are two kinds of \nworkers in the world. One is a person who works in this world for this \nworld and his work for this world keeps him unmindful of the next. He is \nafraid of destitution for those whom he will leave behind but feels safe \nabout it. So, he spends his life seeking the good of others. The other is one \nwho works in this world for what is to come hereafter, and he secures his \nshare of this world without an effort. Thus, he gets both the benefits and \nbecomes the owner of both homes. In this way, he is prestigious before \nAllah. If he asks Allah anything, He does not deny him. \n \n263The learned and the reformers are responsible for improvement as \nwell as deterioration because the common people are under their influence; they \nregard their words and actions as correct and sound. They rely on them and act \nupon their words. Thus, if their teaching caters for improvement, then thousands \nof individuals will acquire improvement and betterment thereby. But if there is \nevil in it, thousands of individuals will get involved in misguidance and straying. \nThat is why it is said: “When a scholar gets into evil, the whole world gets into \nevil.”\n280. It is related that during the days of (caliph) Umar ibn al-\nKhattab, the question of the excess of the ornaments of the Ka‘bah was \nmentioned to him and some people suggested the following: “If you raise \nby it an army of Muslims, it will be a matter of great reward, and what \nwill the Ka‘bah do with the ornaments?” Umar thought of doing so but \nasked Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) what he thought. The Imam said: \nWhen the Quran was revealed to the Prophet (k), there were four kinds \nof property: One, the property of a Muslim which he distributed among \nthe successors according to fixed shares. Second, the tax (fay’) which he \ndistributed to those for whom it was meant. Third, the one-fifth (khums) \nfor which Allah had fixed the ways of disposal. Fourth, the amounts of \ncharity (sadaqat) the disposal of which was also fixed by Allah. The \nornaments of the Ka‘bah did exist in those days, but Allah left them as \nthey were. He did not leave them by omission, nor were they unknown to \nHim. Therefore, you should keep them where Allah and His Prophet \nplaced them. \n \n \nThereupon, Umar ibn al-Khattab said, “If you had not been here, \nwe would have been humiliated.” He left the ornaments as they were.1\nAmong the first three caliphs, `Umar ibn al-Khattab often used to call \nupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) to help him solve many intricate \nproblems, so as to benefit from his vast knowledge. But Abu Bakr, due to \nthe short period of his caliphate, as well as Othman, due to the special \ncircumstances of the latter’s caliphate and entourage, seldom used to call \nupon Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and benefit from his advice. Umar used \nto praise Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) very much for his vast knowledge, \nsaying, “The most knowledgeable person among us in jurisprudence and \njudgement is Ali” (Sahih, al-Bukhari, Vol. 6, p. 23; Al-Musnad, Ahmad \nibn Hanbal, Vol. 5, p. 113; Al-Mustadrak, al-Hakim, Vol. 3, p. 305; At-\nTabaqat, Ibn Sa‘d, Vol. 2, part 2, p. 102; Al-Isti‘ab, Vol. 3, p. 1102). \n \n \nCertainly, there is no need for a testimony from Umar or from \nothers in this regard. Umar himself and a group of the companions \nconfess that the Holy Prophet used to say, “Ali is the most knowledgeable \nin jurisprudence and judgement among my ummah (Muslim community)” \n(Akhbar al-Qudat, Waki‘, Vol. 1, p. 78; Masabih as-Sunnah, al-Baghawi, \nVol. 2, p. 203; Al-Isti‘ab, Vol. 1, pp. 16-17; Vol. 3, p. 1102; Ar-Riyad an-\nNadirah, Vol. 2, p. 108; Al-Sunan, Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, p. 55). \n \n \nIn this regard, Ahmad ibn Hanbal narrates from Abu Hazm that a \ncertain man approached Mu`awiyah and put to him some theological \nquestions. Mu‘awiyah said, “Refer these questions to Ali who possesses \nbetter knowledge.” The man said, “But I rather have your own reply than \nthat of Ali.” Mu’awiyah silenced him and said, “This is the worst thing \nthat I have ever heard from you! You have expressed hatred towards the \nperson whom the Messenger of Allah used to coach and tutor as a mother \nbird feeds a nestling by putting grain after grain into the mouth of the \nnestling with its beak and to whom the Messenger of Allah said: ‘You \nhold the same status in relation to me as Harun held in relation to Musa \nexcept that there shall, in all certainty, be no prophet after me’, and to \nwhom Umar used to turn for the solution of unsolved problems” (Fayd al-\nQadir, al-Munawi, Vol. 3, p. 46; Ar-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 2, p. 195; As-\nSawa‘iq al-Muhriqah, p. 107; Fath al-Bari, Vol. 17, p. 105). \n \n \nAlso, Umar used to say the following quite frequently: “Women \nlack the ability to give birth to the like of Ali ibn Abu Talib. Had it not \nbeen for Ali, Umar would have perished” (Ta’wil Mukhtalaf al-Hadith, \nIbn Qutaybah, p. 202; Al-Isti‘ab, Vol. 3, p. 1103; Qudat al-Andalus, al-\nMaliqi, p. 73; Ar-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 2, p. 194; Al-Manaqib, al-\nKhawarizmi, p. 39; Yanabi‘ al-Mawaddah, p. 75, 373; Fayd al-Qadir, \nVol. 4, p. 356). \n \n \nHe also used to say, “I seek the protection of Allah from the \nproblems for the solution of which Abul-Hassan (Ali) is not present!” \n(Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, pp. 1102-1103; At-Tabaqat, Vol. 2, part 2, p. 102; \nSifatus-Safwah, Ibn al-Jawzi, Vol. 1, p. 121; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. 4, pp. \n22-23; Al-Asabah, Vol. 2, p. 509; At-Tarikh, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 7, p. 360). \n \n \nUmar used to often address Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) thus: “O \nAbul-Hassan! I seek the protection of Allah from being in a community \namong which you are not found” (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 1, pp. 457-458; At-\nTafsir, Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi, Vol. 32, p.10; Ad-Durr al-Manthur; al-\nSayyuti, Vol. 3, p. 144; Ar-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 2, p. 197; Fayd al-\nQadir, Vol. 3, p. 46; Vol. 4, p. 356; As-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqah, p. 107). \n \n \nAbove all, this confession is the acknowledgment by the Holy \nProphet of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) as narrated by Umar ibn al-\nKhattab himself, AbÅ Sa’id al-Khudri and Mu`ath ibn Jabal that the Holy \nProphet said: “O Ali! I have exceeded you in Prophethood, for there will \nbe no prophet after me, and you exceed others in seven noble qualities. \nYou are: i) the first [among all contemporary males] to believe in Allah, \nii) the best fulfiller of the promise made to Allah, iii) the best adherer to \nthe commandments of Allah, iv) the most equitable distributor among the \npeople, v) the best dispenser of justice (or the most clement) to the \n(Muslim) subjects, vi) the one who has the best insight into controversial \nissues (or the most learned in judgement), and vii) the most conspicuous \nin virtue and honor before Allah” (Hilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 1, pp. 65, 66; \nAr-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 2, p. 198; Al-Manaqib, al-Khawarizmi, p. 61; \nKanz al-‘Ummal, Vol. 12, p. 214; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 13, p. 230). \n \n \nIt is also narrated by Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib, Abu Ayyub al-\nAnsari, Ma`qil ibn Yasir and Buraydah ibn Husayb that the Messenger of \nAllah (h) said to Fatima (x), “Are you not satisfied that surely I have \nmarried you to the foremost of my ummah in believing in Islam, the most \nknowledgeable among them and the superior among them in clemency?” \n(Al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 5, p. 26; Al-Musannaf, as-San‘ani, \nVol. 5, p. 490; Al-Isti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1099; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. 5, p. 520; \nKanz al-Ummal, Vol. 12, p. 205; Vol. 15, p. 99; Majma‘ az-Zawa’id, Vol. \n9, pp. 101, 114; As-Sirah al-Halabiyyah, Vol. 1, p. 285). \n \n \nOnce we read the following saying by the Holy Prophet (h), we \nwill no longer be surprised when taking note, based on the above \nacknowledgments, of the vast knowledge of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib, his \nefficiency in the field of jurisprudence and judgement: “I am the city of \nknowledge and Ali is its gate; whoever wants to acquire (my) knowledge \nmust come through the gate. (Al-Mustadrak, Vol. 3, pp. 126, 127; Al-\nIsti`ab, Vol. 3, p. 1102; Usd al-Ghabah, Vol. 4, p. 22; Tahthib at-Tahthib, \nVol. 6, pp. 320-321; Vol. 7, p. 337; Majma’ az-Zawa’id, Vol. 9, p. 114; \nKanz al-Ummal, Vol. 12, pp. 201, 212; Vol. 15, pp. 129-130). \n \n \nAlso, the Holy Prophet (h) said, “I am the store-house of \nwisdom and Ali is its gate. Whoever wants to acquire wisdom must come \nthrough the gate” (Al-Jami‘ as-Sahih, at-Tirmidhi, Vol. 5, pp. 637-638; \nHilyat al-Awliya’, Vol. 1, p. 64; Masabih as-Sunnah, al-Baghawi, Vol. 2, \np. 275; Ar-Riyad an-Nadirah, Vol. 12, p. 193; Kanz al-‘Ummal, Vol. 12, \np. 201). \n \n \n281. It is related that two persons were brought to Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) once. They had stolen a public property. One of them was a \nslave purchased with public money and the other had been purchased by \nsomeone from among the people. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said, “As \nfor this one who has stolen the public property, there is no punishment for \nhim, for it means one who is the property of Allah has taken another \nproperty of Allah. As for the other, he should be punished.” \nConsequently, the thief’s hand was cut off. \n282. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: If my steps acquire \nfirmness out of these slippery places, I will alter several things.264\n \n \nImam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), who was the greatest scholar of the \nShari`a, used to protest against these orders and had his own views about \nthe companions. In this regard, Ibn Abul-Hadid writes the following: \n“There is no possibility for us to deny that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib had \nviews on the commands of the Shari`a and opinions at odds with those of \nthe companions” (Sharh Nahjul-Balagha, Vol. 19, p. 161). \n \n \nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) assumed charge of the formal \ncaliphate, rebellions soon cropped up on all sides and he did not get rid of \nthese troubles up to the last moment. Consequently, the altered commands \ncould not be fully corrected, and many wrong or doubtful commands \ngained currency in areas far removed from the center. Nevertheless, the \ngroup of people who were associated with Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nused to inquire about the commands of the Shari`a from him and recorded \nthem. As a result, the correct commands did not disappear and the wrong \nones did not become unanimously accepted, thanks to Allah. \n \n264It cannot be denied that after the Prophet of Islam (h), changes \ncame into existence in the Islamic faith when some people, acting upon their \nown imagination or inclination, amended or altered the commands of the \nShari`a, although none has the right to make alteration in it. This will be \nignoring the clear commands of the Quran and the Sunnah and enforcing \ncommands produced by one’s own imagination, way of thinking or inclination. \nThus, the Quran contains this clear method of divorce: that “(revokable) divorce \n(i.e. divorce in which resumption of conjugal relations is permissible without a \nmarriage to another man taking place) may be done with two pronouncements” \n(Quran, 2: 229). But in view of certain supposed advantages, caliph `Umar \nordered three pronouncements to be required on a single occasion. Similarly, he \nintroduced the system of ‘awl in inheritance and introduced four takbirs in the \nfuneral prayer. In the same way, caliph Othman added an adhan to the Friday \nprayer service, ordering the offering of full prayers in place of qasr (shortened) \nones, and allowed the sermon to precede the ‘Id prayer service. In fact, hundreds \nof commands of this type were altered or fabricated. As a result, even correct \ncommands got mixed with wrong ones and lost their authenticity. (For such \nchanges to the creed made, see: Al-Ghadir, Al-Amani [by Abu Bakr], Vol. 7, pp. \n74-236; [by Umar], Vol. 6, pp. 83-325; [by Othman], Vol. 8, pp. 98-387; An-\nNass wal-Ijtihad, Sharafu’d-Din [by Abu Bakr], pp. 76-154; [by Umar], pp. \n155-276; [by Othman], pp. 284-289. See also Muqaddimat Mir’atul-Uqul, al-\n‘Askari, Vol. 1 & 2). \n283. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Know with full conviction \nthat Allah has not fixed for any person more livelihood than what has \nbeen ordained in the Book of Destiny, even though his means (of seeking \nit) may be great, his craving for it intense and his efforts for it acute. Nor \ndoes the weakness of a person or the paucity of his means stand in the \nway between what is ordained in the Book of Destiny and himself. \nWhoever realizes it and acts upon it is the best of them all in comfort and \nbenefit, while whoever disregards it and doubts it exceeds all men in \ndisadvantages. Very often, a favored person is being slowly driven \n(towards punishment) through those favors, and very often an afflicted \nperson is being done good through his own affliction. Therefore, O \nlistener, increase your gratefulness, lessen your haste and stay within the \nbounds of your livelihood. \n \n \n284. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do not turn your \nknowledge into ignorance or your conviction into doubt. When you gain \nknowledge act (upon it), and when you acquire conviction, proceed (on its \nbasis).265\n \n \n285. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Greed takes a person to the \nwatering place but brings him back without letting him drink. It \nundertakes responsibility but does not fulfil it. Often, the drinker gets \nchoked before he quenches his thirst. The greater the worth of a thing \nyearned for, the greater is the grief for its loss. Desires blind the eyes of \nunderstanding. The destined share will reach him who does not approach \nit.\n \n \n286. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: O Allah! I seek Your \nprotection from this: that I may appear to be good in the eyes of the \npeople while my inward self may be sinful before You, and that I may \nguard myself (from sinning) only for show before the people although \n \n265Knowledge and conviction demand that they should be acted upon. If \nthey are not acted upon, they cannot be called knowledge and conviction. \nConsequently, if a man says he knows the dangers that exist on particular path \nbut he adopts that very path for his journey instead of the path that has no \ndangers, then who can say that this man had full certainty about the dangers of \nthat path? This is so because the consequence of such certainty should have been \nthat he would have avoided going on that path. Similarly, the person who has a \nfirm belief (i.e. conviction, iman) in the resurrection and revival of life, or in \nchastisement and reward, cannot be overpowered by those things of this world \nthat make a man neglectful to the extent that he disregards the next life, nor can \nhe fall short in good actions for fear of chastisement and evil consequences. \nYou are aware of everything about me. Thus, I appear before the people \nin good shape although my evil acts are placed before You. This means \nachieving nearness to Your creatures but remoteness from Your pleasure. \n \n \n287. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I swear by the One Who \nlet us pass the dark night after which there was a bright day that such and \nsuch266 did not happen. \n \n \n288. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A small action which is \ncontinued with regularity is more beneficial than a long one performed \nwith grudge. \n \n \n289. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When optional issues \nstand in the way of obligatory ones, abandon them. \n \n \n290. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever keeps in view the \ndistance of the journey remains prepared. \n \n \n291. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Perception by the eyes is \nnot real observation because the eyes sometimes deceive people; but \nwisdom does not deceive whomsoever it counsels. \n \n \n292. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Between you and \npreaching there is a curtain of deception. \n \n \n293. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The ignorant among you \nget too much while the learned are just put off. \n \n \n294. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Knowledge dispels the \nexcuse of those who advance excuses. \n \n \n295. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Anyone whom death \novertakes early seeks time while the death of anyone who is deferred puts \nforth excuses for the postponement (of doing good deeds). \n \n \n296. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: For every thing to which \npeople say “how good!” there is an evil hidden in this world. \n \n266Sayyid ar-Radi has not written what it was that did not happen, \nleaving us only with the first part of the sentence! \n297. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked about destitution. He \nsaid the following: It is a dark path; do not tread upon it. It is a deep \nocean; do not dive in it. And it is the secret of Allah; do not take trouble \nabout (knowing) it. \n \n \n298. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: When Allah intends to \nhumiliate a person, He denies him knowledge. \n \n \n \n \n \n299. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: In the past, I had a brother-\nin-faith267, and he was prestigious in my view because the world was \nhumble in his eyes, the needs of the stomach did not have a sway over \nhim. He did not long for what he did not get. If he got a thing, he would \nnot ask for more. He remained most of the time silent. When he spoke, he \nsilenced the other speakers. He quenched the thirst of inquirers. He was \nweak and feeble, but at the time of fighting, he was like the lion of the \nforest or the serpent of the valley: he would not put forth an argument \nunless it was decisive. \n \n \nHe will not abuse anyone in an excusable matter unless he had \nheard the excuse. He would not speak of any trouble except after its \ndisappearance. He said what he would do and would not say what he will \nnot. Even if he could be exceeded in speech, he could not be excelled in \nsilence. He was more eager for keeping quiet than speaking, and if two \nthings confronted him, he would see which was more akin to the longing \nof the heart and he would oppose it. \n \n \nThese qualities are incumbent upon you. So, you should acquire \nthem and compete with each other in upholding them. Even if you cannot \nacquire them, you should know that acquiring a part is better than giving \nup the whole. \n \n \n300. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Even if Allah had not \nwarned of chastisement on those who are disobedient to Him, it will be \n \n267The man whom Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) refers to here as his \n“brother” and whose qualities he has stated has been taken by some \ncommentators to be Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, by some as Othman ibn Maz‘un al-\nJamhi, and by some as al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad al-Kindi. But it is not unlikely \nthat no particular individual is referred to here at all because it is customary with \nArabs to speak of a “brother” or a “comrade” although they have no particular \nindividual in mind. \nobligatory by way of gratitude for His favors that He should not be \ndisobeyed. \n \n \n301. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following to express his \ncondolences to al-Ash‘ath ibn Qays about (the death of) his son: O \nAsh‘ath! If you grieve over your son, certainly it is the consequence of the \nblood relationship; but if you endure, then Allah provides recompense for \nevery affliction. O Ash‘ath! If you endure even then, matters will move \non as ordained by Allah. But in that case, you will deserve to be \nrewarded, while if you lose patience, matters will again move as ordained \nby Allah. But in this case, you will be bearing the burden (of your sins). O \nAsh‘ath! Your son (when he lived) gave you happiness while, at the same \ntime, he was a trial and a hardship and (when he died) he caused you to \ngrieve while, at the same time, he has proved to be a source of reward and \nmercy for you. \n \n \n302. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said the following at the grave \nof the Messenger of Allah (k) at the time of his burial: Certainly \nendurance is good except about you. Fretting is bad except over you. And \nthe affliction about you is great while every other affliction before or after \nit is small. \n \n \n303. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Do not associate with a \nfool because he will beautify his actions before you and wish that you, \ntoo, be like him.268\n \n \n304. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked about the distance \nbetween the East and the West when he replied as follows: A day’s trip \nfor the sun. \n \n268A fool considers his ways of action to be most appropriate, and he \nwants his friend also to adopt the same ways, so that he should become as he \nhimself is. This does not mean that he desires that his friend should become as \nfoolish as he is. He cannot be thinking like this because he does not consider \nhimself to be foolish. If he, in fact, considers himself to be foolish, then he will not \nhave been as such! Rather, he considers his ways of action as correct and desires \nhis friend to be equally “wise”. That is why he presents his view before him in an \nembellished form and desires him to act upon it. It is possible that his friend may \nbe influenced by his advice and tread on the same path. Therefore, it is better to \nkeep away from him. \n305. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Your friends are three and \nyour enemies are (also) three. Your friends are: your friend, your friend’s \nfriend and your enemy’s enemy. And your enemies are: your enemy, your \nfriend’s enemy and your enemy’s friend. \n \n \n306. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) saw a man busy against his \nenemy with what was harmful to his own self as well, so he said: You are \nlike one who pierces a spear through himself in order to kill the person \nsitting behind him. \n \n \n307. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: How many are the \nobjectives of lessons, but how few are those who take lessons!269\n \n \n308. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Whoever goes too far in \nquarreling is a sinner, but if one falls short in it, one is oppressed, and it is \ndifficult for a quarreling person to fear Allah. \n \n \n309. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I am not worried about a \nfault after which I get time to offer prayers in two units (rek‘as) and beg \nsafety from the wrath of Allah.\n \n \n310. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) was asked once: “How will \nAllah conduct the accounting of all persons despite their large number?” \nHe replied: “Just as He provides them livelihood despite their large \nnumber.” Then it was said to Him: “How will He conduct their \naccounting without their seeing Him?” He replied: “Just as He provides \nthem with livelihood although they do not see Him.” \n \n269If the vicissitudes and changes of this world are observed, the \ncircumstances and conditions of the people attended to and their histories noted, \nthen from every corner edifying stories can be heard which are fully capable of \narousing the mind out of its forgetful slumber or providing instruction and \nimparting teaching and clear mindedness. Thus, the creation and dissolution of \neverything in this world, the blossoming of flowers and their withering, the \nthriving of vegetation and its withering away and the subjugation of every atom \nto change are such instructive lessons that they are enough to curb any hope of \nattaining eternity in this deceitful life as long as the eyes and ears are not closed \nto these instructive events. \n \nA Persian couplet says: \nThe world is full of stories of folk gone by, \n But unless one lends an ear to it, its call is feeble.\n311. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Your messenger is the \ninterpreter of your intelligence while your letter is more eloquent in \nexpressing your true self. \n \n \n312. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sƗid: The person who is \nafflicted with hardship is not in a greater need for praying than the one \nwho has been spared affliction but is not immune to it. \n \n \n313. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: People are the progeny of \nthe world and none can be blamed for loving the mother. \n \n \n314. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The destitute person is a \nmessenger of Allah. Whoever denies him denies Allah, and whoever \ngives him gives Allah. \n \n \n315. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A self-respecting man \nnever commits adultery. \n \n \n316. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The fixed limit of life is \nenough to remain watchful.270\n \n \n317. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: A man can sleep over the \ndeath of his child but cannot sleep over the loss of his property. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “This statement means that a man remains \npatient about the death of his children but does not do so at the loss of his \nproperty.” \n \n \n318. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Mutual affection between \nfathers creates a relationship between the sons. Relationship is more in \nneed of affection than affection is for a relationship. \n \n270The idea here is that lighting may flash a hundred thousand times, \ntempests may rise, earth may quake and mountains may collide with each other. \nBut as long as the fixed period of life has yet to run its course, no occurrence can \ncause any harm, nor the typhoon of death may put out the flame of life. There is \na fixed hour for death, and nothing can cut it short before that time. Thus, death \nitself is the watchman and guardian of life. A poet has said, “What is known as \ndeath is the watchman of life.” \n319. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Be afraid of the thoughts \nof believers because Allah, the most Exalted One, has placed the truth on \ntheir tongues. \n \n \n320. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The belief of a person \ncannot be regarded as true unless his trust in what is with Allah is more \nthan his trust in what he himself has. \n \n \n321. When Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) came to Basra, he sent \nAnas ibn Malik to Talhah and az-Zubayr to make them recall what he \n(Anas) himself had heard the Messenger of Allah (k) saying concerning \nthem both, but he avoided doing so. When he came back to Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x), he said that he had forgotten that matter. Thereupon, Imam \nAli ibn Abu Talib (x) said: “If you are speaking a lie, Allah will afflict \nyou with white spots (leucoderm) which even the turban may not cover.” \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “White spot means leucoderma. After \nsometime this disease did occur to Anas’s face, so much so that he was \nnever seen with his face uncovered.”271\n \n271The occasion and circumstances surrounding this statement, as \nrelated by Sayyid ar-Radi, were as follows: During the Battle of Jamal (Camel), \nImam Ali ibn AbuTalib (x) sent Anas ibn Malik to Talhah and az-Zubayr so that \nhe should remind them of the Prophet’s statement to the following effect: “You \nboth will fight Ali and will commit excess in his regard.” Anas ibn Malik went \nback stating that he had forgotten to mention it. Then, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib \n(x) uttered these words about him. However, it is said that Imam Ali ibn Abu \nTalib (x) made this statement when he wanted Anas to confim the Prophet’s \nsaying: “Whoever accepts me as his master, Ali is his master. O Allah! Love \nwhoever loves Ali and hate whoever hates Ali.” Consequently, numerous \npersons have testified to this hadith, but Anas kept quiet [and did not narrate \nit]... Then, Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said to him, “You, too, were present at \nGhadir Khumm. What is keeping you silent on this occasion?” Anas said, “I \nhave grown old and my memory does not serve me well.” Then, Imam Ali ibn \nAbu Talib (x) made this statement (see Ansab al-Ashraf, al-Baladhiri, \nconcerning the biography of Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x), pp. 156-157; Al-A`laq \nan-Nafisah, Ibn Rustah, p. 221; Lata’if al-Ma’arif, ath-Tha`alibi, pp. 105-106; \nMuhadarat al-Udaba’, Ar-Raghib, Vol. 3, p. 293; Ibn Abul-Hadid, Vol. 4, p. 74; \nArjah al-Matalib, Shaikh `Ubaydullah al-Hanafi, pp. 578, 579, 580). In this \nregard, Ibn Qutaybah (Abdullah ibn Muslim ad-Dinawari [231/828-276/889] \nwrites the following: “People have related that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x)\nasked Anas ibn Malik about the Prophet’s saying: ‘O Allah! Love whoever loves \n322. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Sometimes the hearts \nadvance [towards their Creator] and sometimes they retreat. When they \nadvance, get them to perform the optional [acts of worship] (as well). But \nwhen they retreat, keep them confined to only what is obligatory. \n \n \n323. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: The Quran contains news \nabout the past, foretelling about the future and commandments for the \npresent.\n \n \n324. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: Throw a stone in return \nfrom where one comes to you because evil can be met only with evil. \n \n \n325. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said to his secretary \n‘Ubaydullah ibn Abu Rafi‘: Put cotton flake in the ink pot, keep the nib of \nyour pen long, leave some space between the lines and close up the letters \nbecause this is good for the beauty of the writing. \n \n \n326. Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) said: I am the ya‘sÅb (leader) of \nthe believers, while wealth is the leader of the wicked. \n \n \nSayyid ar-Radi says: “It means that the believers follow me while \nthe wicked follow the path that take them to wealth and riches just as the \nbees follow their ‘ya`sub’, their leader.”272\n \nAli and hate whoever hates Ali,’ and he replied, ‘If you are a liar, may Allah \nafflict you with white spots which even the turban may not cover’” (Al-Ma`arif,\np. 580). Ibn Abul-Hadid has also supported this view. Denying his knowledge of \nthe incident mentioned by Sayyid ar-Radi, he writes the following: “The \nincident mentioned by Sayyid ar-Radi that Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) sent \nAnas ibn Malik to Talhah and az-Zubayr is an unrecorded event. If Imam Ali \nibn Abu Talib (x) had sent him particularly to remind them of the Prophet’s \nsaying concerning them, then he could hardly have come back and said that he \nhad forgotten it because when he left Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (x) and went to \nthese two persons, he should have admitted and remembered the saying, and, \ntherefore, how could he, on his return after an hour or a day, plead that he had \nforgotten it and deny it? This is something that cannot happen” (Sharh Nahjul-\nBalagha, Vol. 19, pp. 217-218). \n272We have already explained the meaning of the word “ya`sub” in the \nfootnote of"
